{"title":"ISLTranslate: Dataset for Translating Indian Sign Language","description":"Sign languages are the primary means of communication for many hard-of-hearing people worldwide. Recently, to bridge the communication gap between the hard-of-hearing community and the rest of the population, several sign language translation datasets have been proposed to enable the development of statistical sign language translation systems. However, there is a dearth of sign language resources for the Indian sign language. This resource paper introduces ISLTranslate, a translation dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language (ISL) consisting of 31k ISL-English sentence/phrase pairs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest translation dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset. To validate the performance of existing end-to-end Sign language to spoken language translation systems, we benchmark the created dataset with a transformer-based model for ISL translation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05440v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"On the Need for a Language Describing Distribution Shifts: Illustrations on Tabular Datasets","description":"Different distribution shifts require different algorithmic and operational interventions. Methodological research must be grounded by the specific shifts they address. Although nascent benchmarks provide a promising empirical foundation, they implicitly focus on covariate shifts, and the validity of empirical findings depends on the type of shift, e.g., previous observations on algorithmic performance can fail to be valid when the $Y|X$ distribution changes. We conduct a thorough investigation of natural shifts in 5 tabular datasets over 86,000 model configurations, and find that $Y|X$-shifts are most prevalent. To encourage researchers to develop a refined language for distribution shifts, we build WhyShift, an empirical testbed of curated real-world shifts where we characterize the type of shift we benchmark performance over. Since $Y|X$-shifts are prevalent in tabular settings, we identify covariate regions that suffer the biggest $Y|X$-shifts and discuss implications for algorithmic and data-based interventions. Our testbed highlights the importance of future research that builds an understanding of how distributions differ.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05284v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

Other self reported information is also included (e.g. COVID-19 virus tests), thus providing a comprehensive dataset for the development of COVID-19 risk detection models. The smarty4covid dataset is released in the form of a web-ontology language (OWL) knowledge base enabling data consolidation from other relevant datasets, complex queries and reasoning. It has been utilized towards the development of models able to: (i) extract clinically informative respiratory indicators from regular breathing records, and (ii) identify cough, breath and voice segments in crowd-sourced audio recordings.

{"title":"Vacaspati: A Diverse Corpus of Bangla Literature","description":"Bangla (or Bengali) is the fifth most spoken language globally; yet, the state-of-the-art NLP in Bangla is lagging for even simple tasks such as lemmatization, POS tagging, etc. This is partly due to lack of a varied quality corpus. To alleviate this need, we build Vacaspati, a diverse corpus of Bangla literature. The literary works are collected from various websites; only those works that are publicly available without copyright violations or restrictions are collected. We believe that published literature captures the features of a language much better than newspapers, blogs or social media posts which tend to follow only a certain literary pattern and, therefore, miss out on language variety. Our corpus Vacaspati is varied from multiple aspects, including type of composition, topic, author, time, space, etc. It contains more than 11 million sentences and 115 million words. We also built a word embedding model, Vac-FT, using FastText from Vacaspati as well as trained an Electra model, Vac-BERT, using the corpus. Vac-BERT has far fewer parameters and requires only a fraction of resources compared to other state-of-the-art transformer models and yet performs either better or similar on various downstream tasks. On multiple downstream tasks, Vac-FT outperforms other FastText-based models. We also demonstrate the efficacy of Vacaspati as a corpus by showing that similar models built from other corpora are not as effective.

We produce 1,304 sentence pairs by modifying 15 examples from the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases - modifiers that correspond to universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, negation, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corresponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models under the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existential quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05034v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"Improving the Security of Smartwatch Payment with Deep Learning","description":"Making contactless payments using a smartwatch is increasingly popular, but this payment medium lacks traditional biometric security measures such as facial or fingerprint recognition. In 2022, Sturgess et al. proposed WatchAuth, a system for authenticating smartwatch payments using the physical gesture of reaching towards a payment terminal. While effective, the system requires the user to undergo a burdensome enrolment period to achieve acceptable error levels. In this dissertation, we explore whether applications of deep learning can reduce the number of gestures a user must provide to enrol into an authentication system for smartwatch payment. We firstly construct a deep-learned authentication system that outperforms the current state-of-the-art, including in a scenario where the target user has provided a limited number of gestures. We then develop a regularised autoencoder model for generating synthetic user-specific gestures. We show that using these gestures in training improves classification ability for an authentication system. Through this technique we can reduce the number of gestures required to enrol a user into a WatchAuth-like system without negatively impacting its error rates.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05437v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Differential Analysis of Triggers and Benign Features for Black-Box DNN Backdoor Detection","description":"This paper proposes a data-efficient detection method for deep neural networks against backdoor attacks under a black-box scenario. The proposed approach is motivated by the intuition that features corresponding to triggers have a higher influence in determining the backdoored network output than any other benign features. To quantitatively measure the effects of triggers and benign features on determining the backdoored network output, we introduce five metrics. To calculate the five-metric values for a given input, we first generate several synthetic samples by injecting the input's partial contents into clean validation samples. Then, the five metrics are computed by using the output labels of the corresponding synthetic samples. One contribution of this work is the use of a tiny clean validation dataset. Having the computed five metrics, five novelty detectors are trained from the validation dataset. A meta novelty detector fuses the output of the five trained novelty detectors to generate a meta confidence score. During online testing, our method determines if online samples are poisoned or not via assessing their meta confidence scores output by the meta novelty detector. We show the efficacy of our methodology through a broad range of backdoor attacks, including ablation studies and comparison to existing approaches. Our methodology is promising since the proposed five metrics quantify the inherent differences between clean and poisoned samples. Additionally, our detection method can be incrementally improved by appending more metrics that may be proposed to address future advanced attacks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05422v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Differentially Private Statistical Inference through $\u03b2$-Divergence One Posterior Sampling","description":"Differential privacy guarantees allow the results of a statistical analysis involving sensitive data to be released without compromising the privacy of any individual taking part. Achieving such guarantees generally requires the injection of noise, either directly into parameter estimates or into the estimation process. Instead of artificially introducing perturbations, sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions has been shown to be a special case of the exponential mechanism, producing consistent, and efficient private estimates without altering the data generative process. The application of current approaches has, however, been limited by their strong bounding assumptions which do not hold for basic models, such as simple linear regressors. To ameliorate this, we propose $\\beta$D-Bayes, a posterior sampling scheme from a generalised posterior targeting the minimisation of the $\\beta$-divergence between the model and the data generating process. This provides private estimation that is generally applicable without requiring changes to the underlying model and consistently learns the data generating parameter. We show that $\\beta$D-Bayes produces more precise inference estimation for the same privacy guarantees, and further facilitates differentially private estimation via posterior sampling for complex classifiers and continuous regression models such as neural networks for the first time.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05194v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Membership Inference Attacks on DNNs using Adversarial Perturbations","description":"Several membership inference (MI) attacks have been proposed to audit a target DNN. Given a set of subjects, MI attacks tell which subjects the target DNN has seen during training. This work focuses on the post-training MI attacks emphasizing high confidence membership detection -- True Positive Rates (TPR) at low False Positive Rates (FPR). Current works in this category -- likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) and enhanced MI attack (EMIA) -- only perform well on complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and Imagenet) where the target DNN overfits its train set, but perform poorly on simpler datasets (0% TPR by both attacks on Fashion-MNIST, 2% and 0% TPR respectively by LiRA and EMIA on MNIST at 1% FPR). To address this, firstly, we unify current MI attacks by presenting a framework divided into three stages -- preparation, indication and decision. Secondly, we utilize the framework to propose two novel attacks: (1) Adversarial Membership Inference Attack (AMIA) efficiently utilizes the membership and the non-membership information of the subjects while adversarially minimizing a novel loss function, achieving 6% TPR on both Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets; and (2) Enhanced AMIA (E-AMIA) combines EMIA and AMIA to achieve 8% and 4% TPRs on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets respectively, at 1% FPR. Thirdly, we introduce two novel augmented indicators that positively leverage the loss information in the Gaussian neighborhood of a subject. This improves TPR of all four attacks on average by 2.5% and 0.25% respectively on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets at 1% FPR. Finally, we propose simple, yet novel, evaluation metric, the running TPR average (RTA) at a given FPR, that better distinguishes different MI attacks in the low FPR region. We also show that AMIA and E-AMIA are more transferable to the unknown DNNs (other than the target DNN) and are more robust to DP-SGD training as compared to LiRA and EMIA.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05193v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Transaction Fraud Detection via Spatial-Temporal-Aware Graph Transformer","description":"How to obtain informative representations of transactions and then perform the identification of fraudulent transactions is a crucial part of ensuring financial security. Recent studies apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to the transaction fraud detection problem. Nevertheless, they encounter challenges in effectively learning spatial-temporal information due to structural limitations. Moreover, few prior GNN-based detectors have recognized the significance of incorporating global information, which encompasses similar behavioral patterns and offers valuable insights for discriminative representation learning. Therefore, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network called Spatial-Temporal-Aware Graph Transformer (STA-GT) for transaction fraud detection problems. Specifically, we design a temporal encoding strategy to capture temporal dependencies and incorporate it into the graph neural network framework, enhancing spatial-temporal information modeling and improving expressive ability. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer module to learn local and global information. Pairwise node-node interactions overcome the limitation of the GNN structure and build up the interactions with the target node and long-distance ones. Experimental results on two financial datasets compared to general GNN models and GNN-based fraud detectors demonstrate that our proposed method STA-GT is effective on the transaction fraud detection task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05121v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"Towards Understanding In-Context Learning with Contrastive Demonstrations and Saliency Maps","description":"We investigate the role of various demonstration components in the in-context learning (ICL) performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore the impacts of ground-truth labels, input distribution, and complementary explanations, particularly when these are altered or perturbed. We build on previous work, which offers mixed findings on how these elements influence ICL. To probe these questions, we employ explainable NLP (XNLP) methods and utilize saliency maps of contrastive demonstrations for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our findings reveal that flipping ground-truth labels significantly affects the saliency, though it's more noticeable in larger LLMs. Our analysis of the input distribution at a granular level reveals that changing sentiment-indicative terms in a sentiment analysis task to neutral ones does not have as substantial an impact as altering ground-truth labels. Finally, we find that the effectiveness of complementary explanations in boosting ICL performance is task-dependent, with limited benefits seen in sentiment analysis tasks compared to symbolic reasoning tasks. These insights are critical for understanding the functionality of LLMs and guiding the development of effective demonstrations, which is increasingly relevant in light of the growing use of LLMs in applications such as ChatGPT.

Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \\textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \\textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \\textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model.

{"title":"Optimizing Scientific Data Transfer on Globus with Error-bounded Lossy Compression","description":"The increasing volume and velocity of science data necessitate the frequent movement of enormous data volumes as part of routine research activities. As a result, limited wide-area bandwidth often leads to bottlenecks in research progress. However, in many cases, consuming applications (e.g., for analysis, visualization, and machine learning) can achieve acceptable performance on reduced-precision data, and thus researchers may wish to compromise on data precision to reduce transfer and storage costs. Error-bounded lossy compression presents a promising approach as it can significantly reduce data volumes while preserving data integrity based on user-specified error bounds. In this paper, we propose a novel data transfer framework called Ocelot that integrates error-bounded lossy compression into the Globus data transfer infrastructure. We note four key contributions: (1) Ocelot is the first integration of lossy compression in Globus to significantly improve scientific data transfer performance over wide area network (WAN). (2) We propose an effective machine-learning based lossy compression quality estimation model that can predict the quality of error-bounded lossy compressors, which is fundamental to ensure that transferred data are acceptable to users. (3) We develop optimized strategies to reduce the compression time overhead, counter the compute-node waiting time, and improve transfer speed for compressed files. (4) We perform evaluations using many real-world scientific applications across different domains and distributed Globus endpoints. Our experiments show that Ocelot can improve dataset transfer performance substantially, and the quality of lossy compression (time, ratio and data distortion) can be predicted accurately for the purpose of quality assurance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05416v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Recent progress enabled by super-resolution imaging methods with a data-driven deep learning (DL) framework has balanced the relationship between the core size and resolution. However, most of the DL approaches lack attention to the physical properties of the speckle, which is crucial for reconciling the relationship between the magnification of super-resolution imaging and the quality of reconstruction quality. In the paper, we find that the interferometric process of speckle formation is an essential basis for creating DL models with super-resolution imaging. It physically realizes the upsampling of low-resolution (LR) images and enhances the perceptual capabilities of the models. The finding experimentally validates the role played by the physical upsampling of speckle-driven, effectively complementing the lack of information in data-driven. Experimentally, we break the restriction of the poor reconstruction quality at great magnification by inputting the same size of the speckle with the size of the high-resolution (HR) image to the model. The guidance of our research for endoscopic imaging may accelerate the further development of minimally invasive surgery.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05138v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Prior work has shown that SSL is an effective intermediate representation in two-stage text-to-speech (TTS) for both read and spontaneous speech. However, it is still not clear which SSL and which layer from each SSL model is most suited for spontaneous TTS. We address this shortcoming by extending the scope of comparison for SSL in spontaneous TTS to 6 different SSLs and 3 layers within each SSL. Furthermore, SSL has also shown potential in predicting the mean opinion scores (MOS) of synthesized speech, but this has only been done in read-speech MOS prediction. We extend an SSL-based MOS prediction framework previously developed for scoring read speech synthesis and evaluate its performance on synthesized spontaneous speech. All experiments are conducted twice on two different spontaneous corpora in order to find generalizable trends. Overall, we present comprehensive experimental results on the use of SSL in spontaneous TTS and MOS prediction to further quantify and understand how SSL can be used in spontaneous TTS.

In particular, XAI for time series data has become increasingly important in finance, healthcare, and climate science. However, evaluating the quality of explanations, such as attributions provided by XAI techniques, remains challenging. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of using perturbations to evaluate attributions extracted from time series models. A perturbation analysis involves systematically modifying the input data and evaluating the impact on the attributions generated by the XAI method. We apply this approach to several state-of-the-art XAI techniques and evaluate their performance on three time series classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that the perturbation analysis approach can effectively evaluate the quality of attributions and provide insights into the strengths and limitations of XAI techniques. Such an approach can guide the selection of XAI methods for time series data, e.g., focusing on return time rather than precision, and facilitate the development of more reliable and interpretable machine learning models for time series analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05104v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

This helps prioritize what data to review in order to ensure a high-quality training/evaluation dataset, which is critical in sensitive applications such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. Widely applicable, our label quality scores rely on probabilistic predictions from a trained segmentation model -- any model architecture and training procedure can be utilized. Here we study 7 different label quality scoring methods used in conjunction with a DeepLabV3+ or a FPN segmentation model to detect annotation errors in a version of the SYNTHIA dataset. Precision-recall evaluations reveal a score -- the soft-minimum of the model-estimated likelihoods of each pixel's annotated class -- that is particularly effective to identify images that are mislabeled, across multiple types of annotation error.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05080v1","created":"2023-07-11","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
