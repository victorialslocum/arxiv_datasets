We develop new annotation guidelines for the task, which are not limited to language-specific cues, and apply them to produce a new corpus in English. The corpus consists of 411 subjective and 638 objective sentences extracted from ongoing coverage of political affairs from online news outlets. This new resource paves the way for the development of models for subjectivity detection in English and across other languages, without relying on language-specific tools like lexicons or machine translation. We evaluate state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models on the task, both in mono- and cross-lingual settings, the latter with a similar existing corpus in Italian language. We observe that enriching our corpus with resources in other languages improves the results on the task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18034v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"VCVW-3D: A Virtual Construction Vehicles and Workers Dataset with 3D Annotations","description":"Currently, object detection applications in construction are almost based on pure 2D data (both image and annotation are 2D-based), resulting in the developed artificial intelligence (AI) applications only applicable to some scenarios that only require 2D information. However, most advanced applications usually require AI agents to perceive 3D spatial information, which limits the further development of the current computer vision (CV) in construction. The lack of 3D annotated datasets for construction object detection worsens the situation. Therefore, this study creates and releases a virtual dataset with 3D annotations named VCVW-3D, which covers 15 construction scenes and involves ten categories of construction vehicles and workers. The VCVW-3D dataset is characterized by multi-scene, multi-category, multi-randomness, multi-viewpoint, multi-annotation, and binocular vision. Several typical 2D and monocular 3D object detection models are then trained and evaluated on the VCVW-3D dataset to provide a benchmark for subsequent research. The VCVW-3D is expected to bring considerable economic benefits and practical significance by reducing the costs of data construction, prototype development, and exploration of space-awareness applications, thus promoting the development of CV in construction, especially those of 3D applications.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17927v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"TotalDefMeme: A Multi-Attribute Meme dataset on Total Defence in Singapore","description":"Total Defence is a defence policy combining and extending the concept of military defence and civil defence. While several countries have adopted total defence as their defence policy, very few studies have investigated its effectiveness. With the rapid proliferation of social media and digitalisation, many social studies have been focused on investigating policy effectiveness through specially curated surveys and questionnaires either through digital media or traditional forms. However, such references may not truly reflect the underlying sentiments about the target policies or initiatives of interest. People are more likely to express their sentiment using communication mediums such as starting topic thread on forums or sharing memes on social media. Using Singapore as a case reference, this study aims to address this research gap by proposing TotalDefMeme, a large-scale multi-modal and multi-attribute meme dataset that captures public sentiments toward Singapore's Total Defence policy. Besides supporting social informatics and public policy analysis of the Total Defence policy, TotalDefMeme can also support many downstream multi-modal machine learning tasks, such as aspect-based stance classification and multi-modal meme clustering. We perform baseline machine learning experiments on TotalDefMeme and evaluate its technical validity, and present possible future interdisciplinary research directions and application scenarios using the dataset as a baseline.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17911v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts","description":"Recent releases of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, are astonishing at generating human-like texts, but they may get misused for fake scholarly texts, fake news, fake tweets, et cetera. Previous works have proposed methods to detect these multiscale AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based training-agnostic methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors are formulated without considering the factor of corpus length: shorter corpuses are harder to detect compared with longer ones for shortage of informative features. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the challenge of multiscale text detection. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase text classification as a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by marking these short machine texts as \"unlabeled\" during training. In this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where we use a recurrent model in abstraction to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpuses. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpuses. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated text, and significantly improves short-corpus detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors by large margins on multiscale AI-generated texts. The codes are available at https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/detect_chatgpt and https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing/AIGC_text_detector.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18149v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

However, existing works mainly focus on investigating the capabilities of conversational LLMs on chemical reaction and retrosynthesis. While drug editing, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ChatDrug, a framework to facilitate the systematic investigation of drug editing using LLMs. ChatDrug jointly leverages a prompt module, a retrieval and domain feedback (ReDF) module, and a conversation module to streamline effective drug editing. We empirically show that ChatDrug reaches the best performance on 33 out of 39 drug editing tasks, encompassing small molecules, peptides, and proteins. We further demonstrate, through 10 case studies, that ChatDrug can successfully identify the key substructures (e.g., the molecule functional groups, peptide motifs, and protein structures) for manipulation, generating diverse and valid suggestions for drug editing. Promisingly, we also show that ChatDrug can offer insightful explanations from a domain-specific perspective, enhancing interpretability and enabling informed decision-making. This research sheds light on the potential of ChatGPT and conversational LLMs for drug editing. It paves the way for a more efficient and collaborative drug discovery pipeline, contributing to the advancement of pharmaceutical research and development.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18090v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTrans which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTrans is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTrans model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTrans performs comparably with ChatGPT and Google Translate in many languages and even outperforms ChatGPT in 8 language pairs.

{"title":"InstructEdit: Improving Automatic Masks for Diffusion-based Image Editing With User Instructions","description":"Recent works have explored text-guided image editing using diffusion models and generated edited images based on text prompts. However, the models struggle to accurately locate the regions to be edited and faithfully perform precise edits. In this work, we propose a framework termed InstructEdit that can do fine-grained editing based on user instructions. Our proposed framework has three components: language processor, segmenter, and image editor. The first component, the language processor, processes the user instruction using a large language model. The goal of this processing is to parse the user instruction and output prompts for the segmenter and captions for the image editor. We adopt ChatGPT and optionally BLIP2 for this step. The second component, the segmenter, uses the segmentation prompt provided by the language processor. We employ a state-of-the-art segmentation framework Grounded Segment Anything to automatically generate a high-quality mask based on the segmentation prompt. The third component, the image editor, uses the captions from the language processor and the masks from the segmenter to compute the edited image. We adopt Stable Diffusion and the mask-guided generation from DiffEdit for this purpose. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous editing methods in fine-grained editing applications where the input image contains a complex object or multiple objects. We improve the mask quality over DiffEdit and thus improve the quality of edited images. We also show that our framework can accept multiple forms of user instructions as input.

{"title":"Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators","description":"We uncover a systematic bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models~(LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., vicuna could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries. To address this issue, we propose two simple yet effective calibration strategies: 1) Multiple Evidence Calibration, which requires the evaluator model to generate multiple detailed pieces of evidence before assigning ratings; 2) Balanced Position Calibration, which aggregates results across various orders to determine the final score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments. To facilitate future research on more robust large language model comparison, we integrate the techniques in the paper into an easy-to-use toolkit \\emph{FairEval}, along with the human annotations.\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/i-Eval/FairEval}}","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17926v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}
{"title":"The Utility of Large Language Models and Generative AI for Education Research","description":"The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze over 1,000 student essays in which students discussed their career interests. The specific assignment prompted students to define and explain their career goals as engineers. Using text embedding representations of student responses, we clustered the responses together to identify thematically similar statements from students. The clustered responses were then summarized to quickly identify career interest themes. We also used a set of a priori codes about career satisfaction and sectors to demonstrate an alternative approach to using these generative text models to analyze student writing. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of NLP techniques in engineering education research. By automating the initial analysis of student essays, researchers and educators can more efficiently and accurately identify key themes and patterns in student writing. The methods presented in this paper have broader applications for engineering education and research purposes beyond analyzing student essays. By explaining these methods to the engineering education community, readers can utilize them in their own contexts.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18125v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}

The research involved twenty-two GPT-4 generated submissions being created and included in the assessment process to be marked by fifteen different faculty members. The study reveals that although the detection tool identified 91% of the experimental submissions as containing some AI-generated content, the total detected content was only 54.8%. This suggests that the use of adversarial techniques regarding prompt engineering is an effective method in evading AI detection tools and highlights that improvements to AI detection software are needed. Using the Turnitin AI detect tool, faculty reported 54.5% of the experimental submissions to the academic misconduct process, suggesting the need for increased awareness and training into these tools. Genuine submissions received a mean score of 54.4, whereas AI-generated content scored 52.3, indicating the comparable performance of GPT-4 in real-life situations. Recommendations include adjusting assessment strategies to make them more resistant to the use of AI tools, using AI-inclusive assessment where possible, and providing comprehensive training programs for faculty and students. This research contributes to understanding the relationship between AI-generated content and academic assessment, urging further investigation to preserve academic integrity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18081v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}

To address these challenges, we present ContrastNER, a prompt-based NER framework that employs both discrete and continuous tokens in prompts and uses a contrastive learning approach to learn the continuous prompts and forecast entity types. The experimental results demonstrate that ContrastNER obtains competitive performance to the state-of-the-art NER methods in high-resource settings and outperforms the state-of-the-art models in low-resource circumstances without requiring extensive manual prompt engineering and verbalizer design.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17951v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}
{"title":"Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model","description":"While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Synfeal: A Data-Driven Simulator for End-to-End Camera Localization","description":"Collecting real-world data is often considered the bottleneck of Artificial Intelligence, stalling the research progress in several fields, one of which is camera localization. End-to-end camera localization methods are still outperformed by traditional methods, and we argue that the inconsistencies associated with the data collection techniques are restraining the potential of end-to-end methods. Inspired by the recent data-centric paradigm, we propose a framework that synthesizes large localization datasets based on realistic 3D reconstructions of the real world. Our framework, termed Synfeal: Synthetic from Real, is an open-source, data-driven simulator that synthesizes RGB images by moving a virtual camera through a realistic 3D textured mesh, while collecting the corresponding ground-truth camera poses. The results validate that the training of camera localization algorithms on datasets generated by Synfeal leads to better results when compared to datasets generated by state-of-the-art methods. Using Synfeal, we conducted the first analysis of the relationship between the size of the dataset and the performance of camera localization algorithms. Results show that the performance significantly increases with the dataset size. Our results also suggest that when a large localization dataset with high quality is available, training from scratch leads to better performances.

{"title":"Reason to explain: Interactive contrastive explanations (REASONX)","description":"Many high-performing machine learning models are not interpretable. As they are increasingly used in decision scenarios that can critically affect individuals, it is necessary to develop tools to better understand their outputs. Popular explanation methods include contrastive explanations. However, they suffer several shortcomings, among others an insufficient incorporation of background knowledge, and a lack of interactivity. While (dialogue-like) interactivity is important to better communicate an explanation, background knowledge has the potential to significantly improve their quality, e.g., by adapting the explanation to the needs of the end-user. To close this gap, we present REASONX, an explanation tool based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). REASONX provides interactive contrastive explanations that can be augmented by background knowledge, and allows to operate under a setting of under-specified information, leading to increased flexibility in the provided explanations. REASONX computes factual and constrative decision rules, as well as closest constrative examples. It provides explanations for decision trees, which can be the ML models under analysis, or global/local surrogate models of any ML model. While the core part of REASONX is built on CLP, we also provide a program layer that allows to compute the explanations via Python, making the tool accessible to a wider audience. We illustrate the capability of REASONX on a synthetic data set, and on a a well-developed example in the credit domain. In both cases, we can show how REASONX can be flexibly used and tailored to the needs of the user.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18143v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

This phase was not covered by the previous work. In particular, the focus will be on using the results of a TA done with the LLM on a dataset of user interviews, for writing user personas, with the model building on the TA to produce the personas narratives. User personas are models of real users, usually built from a data analysis like interviews with a sample of users. User personas are tools often used in User Centered Design processes.

{"title":"Towards a Robust Framework for NeRF Evaluation","description":"Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) research has attracted significant attention recently, with 3D modelling, virtual/augmented reality, and visual effects driving its application. While current NeRF implementations can produce high quality visual results, there is a conspicuous lack of reliable methods for evaluating them. Conventional image quality assessment methods and analytical metrics (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS etc.) only provide approximate indicators of performance since they generalise the ability of the entire NeRF pipeline. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new test framework which isolates the neural rendering network from the NeRF pipeline and then performs a parametric evaluation by training and evaluating the NeRF on an explicit radiance field representation. We also introduce a configurable approach for generating representations specifically for evaluation purposes. This employs ray-casting to transform mesh models into explicit NeRF samples, as well as to \"shade\" these representations. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate how different \"tasks\" (scenes with different visual effects or learning strategies) and types of networks (NeRFs and depth-wise implicit neural representations (INRs)) can be evaluated within this framework. Additionally, we propose a novel metric to measure task complexity of the framework which accounts for the visual parameters and the distribution of the spatial data. Our approach offers the potential to create a comparative objective evaluation framework for NeRF methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18079v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"The mechanism underlying successful deep learning","description":"Deep architectures consist of tens or hundreds of convolutional layers (CLs) that terminate with a few fully connected (FC) layers and an output layer representing the possible labels of a complex classification task. According to the existing deep learning (DL) rationale, the first CL reveals localized features from the raw data, whereas the subsequent layers progressively extract higher-level features required for refined classification. This article presents an efficient three-phase procedure for quantifying the mechanism underlying successful DL. First, a deep architecture is trained to maximize the success rate (SR). Next, the weights of the first several CLs are fixed and only the concatenated new FC layer connected to the output is trained, resulting in SRs that progress with the layers. Finally, the trained FC weights are silenced, except for those emerging from a single filter, enabling the quantification of the functionality of this filter using a correlation matrix between input labels and averaged output fields, hence a well-defined set of quantifiable features is obtained. Each filter essentially selects a single output label independent of the input label, which seems to prevent high SRs; however, it counterintuitively identifies a small subset of possible output labels. This feature is an essential part of the underlying DL mechanism and is progressively sharpened with layers, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratios and SRs. Quantitatively, this mechanism is exemplified by the VGG-16, VGG-6, and AVGG-16. The proposed mechanism underlying DL provides an accurate tool for identifying each filter's quality and is expected to direct additional procedures to improve the SR, computational complexity, and latency of DL.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18078v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images that are semantically coherent with given texts. This presents an opportunity to generate synthetic training images for TIC. However, we have identified a challenge that the images generated from simple descriptions typically exhibit a single perspective with one or limited contexts, which is not aligned with the complexity of real-world scenes in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses this issue by introducing multi-context data generation. Starting with an initial text corpus, our framework employs a large language model to select multiple sentences that describe the same scene from various perspectives. These sentences are then summarized into a single sentence with multiple contexts. We generate simple images using the straightforward sentences and complex images using the summarized sentences through diffusion models. Finally, we train the model exclusively using the synthetic image-text pairs obtained from this process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively tackles the central challenge we have identified, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and SS1M.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18072v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Leveraging Evolutionary Changes for Software Process Quality","description":"Real-world software applications must constantly evolve to remain relevant. This evolution occurs when developing new applications or adapting existing ones to meet new requirements, make corrections, or incorporate future functionality. Traditional methods of software quality control involve software quality models and continuous code inspection tools. These measures focus on directly assessing the quality of the software. However, there is a strong correlation and causation between the quality of the development process and the resulting software product. Therefore, improving the development process indirectly improves the software product, too. To achieve this, effective learning from past processes is necessary, often embraced through post mortem organizational learning. While qualitative evaluation of large artifacts is common, smaller quantitative changes captured by application lifecycle management are often overlooked. In addition to software metrics, these smaller changes can reveal complex phenomena related to project culture and management. Leveraging these changes can help detect and address such complex issues.   Software evolution was previously measured by the size of changes, but the lack of consensus on a reliable and versatile quantification method prevents its use as a dependable metric. Different size classifications fail to reliably describe the nature of evolution. While application lifecycle management data is rich, identifying which artifacts can model detrimental managerial practices remains uncertain. Approaches such as simulation modeling, discrete events simulation, or Bayesian networks have only limited ability to exploit continuous-time process models of such phenomena.

Despite existing methods achieving impressive results in this task, there is still room for improvement in generating high-quality stylized faces with diverse styles and accurate facial reconstruction. Our proposed framework, MMFS, supports multi-modal face stylization by leveraging the strengths of StyleGAN and integrates it into an encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we use the mid-resolution and high-resolution layers of StyleGAN as the decoder to generate high-quality faces, while aligning its low-resolution layer with the encoder to extract and preserve input facial details. We also introduce a two-stage training strategy, where we train the encoder in the first stage to align the feature maps with StyleGAN and enable a faithful reconstruction of input faces. In the second stage, the entire network is fine-tuned with artistic data for stylized face generation. To enable the fine-tuned model to be applied in zero-shot and one-shot stylization tasks, we train an additional mapping network from the large-scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) space to a latent $w+$ space of fine-tuned StyleGAN. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our framework achieves superior face stylization performance in both one-shot and zero-shot stylization tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18009v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

To explore the mechanism of cooperative sensing and computation offloading in this system, we aim at maximizing the total completed sensed bits of all users and RISs by jointly optimizing the time allocation parameter, the passive beamforming at each RIS, the transmit beamforming at BS, and the energy partition parameters for all users subject to the size of sensed data, energy supply and given time cycle. The formulated nonconvex problem is tightly coupled by the time allocation parameter and involves the mathematical expectations, which cannot be solved straightly. We use Monte Carlo and fractional programming methods to transform the nonconvex objective function and then propose an alternating optimization-based algorithm to find an approximate solution with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results show that the RIS-aided SR system outperforms other benchmarks in sensing. Furthermore, with the aid of RIS, the channel and system performance can be significantly improved.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17928v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Hence, extracting the input validation constraints is required for generating high-quality test cases. Existing techniques rely on either human effort or documentation of DL library APIs to extract the constraints. They cannot extract complex constraints and the extracted constraints may differ from the actual code implementation.   To address the challenge, we propose ACETest, a technique to automatically extract input validation constraints from the code to build valid yet diverse test cases which can effectively unveil bugs in the core function logic of DL operators. For this purpose, ACETest can automatically identify the input validation code in DL operators, extract the related constraints and generate test cases according to the constraints. The experimental results on popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch, demonstrate that ACETest can extract constraints with higher quality than state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Moreover, ACETest is capable of extracting 96.4% more constraints and detecting 1.95 to 55 times more bugs than SOTA techniques. In total, we have used ACETest to detect 108 previously unknown bugs on TensorFlow and PyTorch, with 87 of them confirmed by the developers. Lastly, five of the bugs were assigned with CVE IDs due to their security impacts.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17914v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Byte-Level Grammatical Error Correction Using Synthetic and Curated Corpora","description":"Grammatical error correction (GEC) is the task of correcting typos, spelling, punctuation and grammatical issues in text. Approaching the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we compare the use of a common subword unit vocabulary and byte-level encoding. Initial synthetic training data is created using an error-generating pipeline, and used for finetuning two subword-level models and one byte-level model. Models are then finetuned further on hand-corrected error corpora, including texts written by children, university students, dyslexic and second-language writers, and evaluated over different error types and origins. We show that a byte-level model enables higher correction quality than a subword approach, not only for simple spelling errors, but also for more complex semantic, stylistic and grammatical issues. In particular, initial training on synthetic corpora followed by finetuning on a relatively small parallel corpus of real-world errors helps the byte-level model correct a wide range of commonly occurring errors. Our experiments are run for the Icelandic language but should hold for other similar languages, particularly morphologically rich ones.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17906v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Ask an Expert: Leveraging Language Models to Improve Strategic Reasoning in Goal-Oriented Dialogue Models","description":"Existing dialogue models may encounter scenarios which are not well-represented in the training data, and as a result generate responses that are unnatural, inappropriate, or unhelpful. We propose the \"Ask an Expert\" framework in which the model is trained with access to an \"expert\" which it can consult at each turn. Advice is solicited via a structured dialogue with the expert, and the model is optimized to selectively utilize (or ignore) it given the context and dialogue history. In this work the expert takes the form of an LLM. We evaluate this framework in a mental health support domain, where the structure of the expert conversation is outlined by pre-specified prompts which reflect a reasoning strategy taught to practitioners in the field. Blenderbot models utilizing \"Ask an Expert\" show quality improvements across all expert sizes, including those with fewer parameters than the dialogue model itself. Our best model provides a $\\sim 10\\%$ improvement over baselines, approaching human-level scores on \"engingingness\" and \"helpfulness\" metrics.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17878v1","created":"2023-05-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
