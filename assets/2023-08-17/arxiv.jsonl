{"title":"Advancing continual lifelong learning in neural information retrieval: definition, dataset, framework, and empirical evaluation","description":"Continual learning refers to the capability of a machine learning model to learn and adapt to new information, without compromising its performance on previously learned tasks. Although several studies have investigated continual learning methods for information retrieval tasks, a well-defined task formulation is still lacking, and it is unclear how typical learning strategies perform in this context. To address this challenge, a systematic task formulation of continual neural information retrieval is presented, along with a multiple-topic dataset that simulates continuous information retrieval. A comprehensive continual neural information retrieval framework consisting of typical retrieval models and continual learning strategies is then proposed. Empirical evaluations illustrate that the proposed framework can successfully prevent catastrophic forgetting in neural information retrieval and enhance performance on previously learned tasks. The results indicate that embedding-based retrieval models experience a decline in their continual learning performance as the topic shift distance and dataset volume of new tasks increase. In contrast, pretraining-based models do not show any such correlation. Adopting suitable learning strategies can mitigate the effects of topic shift and data augmentation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08378v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"ECPC-IDS:A benchmark endometrail cancer PET/CT image dataset for evaluation of semantic segmentation and detection of hypermetabolic regions","description":"Endometrial cancer is one of the most common tumors in the female reproductive system and is the third most common gynecological malignancy that causes death after ovarian and cervical cancer. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of patients. With the development of artificial intelligence, computer-assisted diagnosis plays an increasingly important role in improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnosis, as well as reducing the workload of doctors. However, the absence of publicly available endometrial cancer image datasets restricts the application of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques.In this paper, a publicly available Endometrial Cancer PET/CT Image Dataset for Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation and Detection of Hypermetabolic Regions (ECPC-IDS) are published. Specifically, the segmentation section includes PET and CT images, with a total of 7159 images in multiple formats. In order to prove the effectiveness of segmentation methods on ECPC-IDS, five classical deep learning semantic segmentation methods are selected to test the image segmentation task. The object detection section also includes PET and CT images, with a total of 3579 images and XML files with annotation information. Six deep learning methods are selected for experiments on the detection task.This study conduct extensive experiments using deep learning-based semantic segmentation and object detection methods to demonstrate the differences between various methods on ECPC-IDS. As far as we know, this is the first publicly available dataset of endometrial cancer with a large number of multiple images, including a large amount of information required for image and target detection. ECPC-IDS can aid researchers in exploring new algorithms to enhance computer-assisted technology, benefiting both clinical doctors and patients greatly.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08313v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"CARE: A Large Scale CT Image Dataset and Clinical Applicable Benchmark Model for Rectal Cancer Segmentation","description":"Rectal cancer segmentation of CT image plays a crucial role in timely clinical diagnosis, radiotherapy treatment, and follow-up. Although current segmentation methods have shown promise in delineating cancerous tissues, they still encounter challenges in achieving high segmentation precision. These obstacles arise from the intricate anatomical structures of the rectum and the difficulties in performing differential diagnosis of rectal cancer. Additionally, a major obstacle is the lack of a large-scale, finely annotated CT image dataset for rectal cancer segmentation. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel large scale rectal cancer CT image dataset CARE with pixel-level annotations for both normal and cancerous rectum, which serves as a valuable resource for algorithm research and clinical application development. Moreover, we propose a novel medical cancer lesion segmentation benchmark model named U-SAM. The model is specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by the intricate anatomical structures of abdominal organs by incorporating prompt information. U-SAM contains three key components: promptable information (e.g., points) to aid in target area localization, a convolution module for capturing low-level lesion details, and skip-connections to preserve and recover spatial information during the encoding-decoding process. To evaluate the effectiveness of U-SAM, we systematically compare its performance with several popular segmentation methods on the CARE dataset. The generalization of the model is further verified on the WORD dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed U-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these two datasets. These experiments can serve as the baseline for future research and clinical application development.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08283v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"AATCT-IDS: A Benchmark Abdominal Adipose Tissue CT Image Dataset for Image Denoising, Semantic Segmentation, and Radiomics Evaluation","description":"Methods: In this study, a benchmark \\emph{Abdominal Adipose Tissue CT Image Dataset} (AATTCT-IDS) containing 300 subjects is prepared and published. AATTCT-IDS publics 13,732 raw CT slices, and the researchers individually annotate the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue regions of 3,213 of those slices that have the same slice distance to validate denoising methods, train semantic segmentation models, and study radiomics. For different tasks, this paper compares and analyzes the performance of various methods on AATTCT-IDS by combining the visualization results and evaluation data. Thus, verify the research potential of this data set in the above three types of tasks.   Results: In the comparative study of image denoising, algorithms using a smoothing strategy suppress mixed noise at the expense of image details and obtain better evaluation data. Methods such as BM3D preserve the original image structure better, although the evaluation data are slightly lower. The results show significant differences among them. In the comparative study of semantic segmentation of abdominal adipose tissue, the segmentation results of adipose tissue by each model show different structural characteristics. Among them, BiSeNet obtains segmentation results only slightly inferior to U-Net with the shortest training time and effectively separates small and isolated adipose tissue. In addition, the radiomics study based on AATTCT-IDS reveals three adipose distributions in the subject population.   Conclusion: AATTCT-IDS contains the ground truth of adipose tissue regions in abdominal CT slices. This open-source dataset can attract researchers to explore the multi-dimensional characteristics of abdominal adipose tissue and thus help physicians and patients in clinical practice.

Driven by this, we introduce MDDial, the first differential diagnosis dialogue dataset in English which can aid to build and evaluate end-to-end ADD dialogue systems. Additionally, earlier studies present the accuracy of diagnosis and symptoms either individually or as a combined weighted score. This method overlooks the connection between the symptoms and the diagnosis. We introduce a unified score for the ADD system that takes into account the interplay between symptoms and diagnosis. This score also indicates the system's reliability. To the end, we train two moderate-size of language models on MDDial. Our experiments suggest that while these language models can perform well on many natural language understanding tasks, including dialogue tasks in the general domain, they struggle to relate relevant symptoms and disease and thus have poor performance on MDDial. MDDial will be released publicly to aid the study of ADD dialogue research.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08147v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Test-Time Poisoning Attacks Against Test-Time Adaptation Models","description":"Deploying machine learning (ML) models in the wild is challenging as it suffers from distribution shifts, where the model trained on an original domain cannot generalize well to unforeseen diverse transfer domains. To address this challenge, several test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to improve the generalization ability of the target pre-trained models under test data to cope with the shifted distribution. The success of TTA can be credited to the continuous fine-tuning of the target model according to the distributional hint from the test samples during test time. Despite being powerful, it also opens a new attack surface, i.e., test-time poisoning attacks, which are substantially different from previous poisoning attacks that occur during the training time of ML models (i.e., adversaries cannot intervene in the training process). In this paper, we perform the first test-time poisoning attack against four mainstream TTA methods, including TTT, DUA, TENT, and RPL. Concretely, we generate poisoned samples based on the surrogate models and feed them to the target TTA models. Experimental results show that the TTA methods are generally vulnerable to test-time poisoning attacks. For instance, the adversary can feed as few as 10 poisoned samples to degrade the performance of the target model from 76.20% to 41.83%. Our results demonstrate that TTA algorithms lacking a rigorous security assessment are unsuitable for deployment in real-life scenarios. As such, we advocate for the integration of defenses against test-time poisoning attacks into the design of TTA methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08505v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Time Travel in LLMs: Tracing Data Contamination in Large Language Models","description":"Data contamination, i.e., the presence of test data from downstream tasks in the training data of large language models (LLMs), is a potential major issue in understanding LLMs' effectiveness on other tasks. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination in individual instances that are drawn from a small random sample; using this information, our approach then assesses if an entire dataset partition is contaminated. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ \"guided instruction:\" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or closely matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the guided instruction vs. a general instruction that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with in-context learning prompting marks multiple instances as contaminated. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human expert. Further, our findings indicate that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08493v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Diff-CAPTCHA: An Image-based CAPTCHA with Security Enhanced by Denoising Diffusion Model","description":"To enhance the security of text CAPTCHAs, various methods have been employed, such as adding the interference lines on the text, randomly distorting the characters, and overlapping multiple characters. These methods partly increase the difficulty of automated segmentation and recognition attacks. However, facing the rapid development of the end-to-end breaking algorithms, their security has been greatly weakened. The diffusion model is a novel image generation model that can generate the text images with deep fusion of characters and background images. In this paper, an image-click CAPTCHA scheme called Diff-CAPTCHA is proposed based on denoising diffusion models. The background image and characters of the CAPTCHA are treated as a whole to guide the generation process of a diffusion model, thus weakening the character features available for machine learning, enhancing the diversity of character features in the CAPTCHA, and increasing the difficulty of breaking algorithms. To evaluate the security of Diff-CAPTCHA, this paper develops several attack methods, including end-to-end attacks based on Faster R-CNN and two-stage attacks, and Diff-CAPTCHA is compared with three baseline schemes, including commercial CAPTCHA scheme and security-enhanced CAPTCHA scheme based on style transfer. The experimental results show that diffusion models can effectively enhance CAPTCHA security while maintaining good usability in human testing.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08367v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Independent Distribution Regularization for Private Graph Embedding","description":"Learning graph embeddings is a crucial task in graph mining tasks. An effective graph embedding model can learn low-dimensional representations from graph-structured data for data publishing benefiting various downstream applications such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, recent studies have revealed that graph embeddings are susceptible to attribute inference attacks, which allow attackers to infer private node attributes from the learned graph embeddings. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving graph embedding methods have emerged, aiming to simultaneously consider primary learning and privacy protection through adversarial learning. However, most existing methods assume that representation models have access to all sensitive attributes in advance during the training stage, which is not always the case due to diverse privacy preferences. Furthermore, the commonly used adversarial learning technique in privacy-preserving representation learning suffers from unstable training issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Private Variational Graph AutoEncoders (PVGAE) with the aid of independent distribution penalty as a regularization term. Specifically, we split the original variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to learn sensitive and non-sensitive latent representations using two sets of encoders. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization to enforce the independence of the encoders. We prove the theoretical effectiveness of regularization from the perspective of mutual information. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PVGAE outperforms other baselines in private embedding learning regarding utility performance and privacy protection.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08360v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Endogenous Macrodynamics in Algorithmic Recourse","description":"Existing work on Counterfactual Explanations (CE) and Algorithmic Recourse (AR) has largely focused on single individuals in a static environment: given some estimated model, the goal is to find valid counterfactuals for an individual instance that fulfill various desiderata. The ability of such counterfactuals to handle dynamics like data and model drift remains a largely unexplored research challenge. There has also been surprisingly little work on the related question of how the actual implementation of recourse by one individual may affect other individuals. Through this work, we aim to close that gap. We first show that many of the existing methodologies can be collectively described by a generalized framework. We then argue that the existing framework does not account for a hidden external cost of recourse, that only reveals itself when studying the endogenous dynamics of recourse at the group level. Through simulation experiments involving various state-of the-art counterfactual generators and several benchmark datasets, we generate large numbers of counterfactuals and study the resulting domain and model shifts. We find that the induced shifts are substantial enough to likely impede the applicability of Algorithmic Recourse in some situations. Fortunately, we find various strategies to mitigate these concerns. Our simulation framework for studying recourse dynamics is fast and opensourced.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08187v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Privacy-Preserving Push-Pull Method for Decentralized Optimization via State Decomposition","description":"Distributed optimization is manifesting great potential in multiple fields, e.g., machine learning, control, and resource allocation. Existing decentralized optimization algorithms require sharing explicit state information among the agents, which raises the risk of private information leakage. To ensure privacy security, combining information security mechanisms, such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, with traditional decentralized optimization algorithms is a commonly used means. However, this would either sacrifice optimization accuracy or incur heavy computational burden. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop a novel privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithm, called PPSD, that combines gradient tracking with a state decomposition mechanism. Specifically, each agent decomposes its state associated with the gradient into two substates. One substate is used for interaction with neighboring agents, and the other substate containing private information acts only on the first substate and thus is entirely agnostic to other agents. For the strongly convex and smooth objective functions, PPSD attains a $R$-linear convergence rate. Moreover, the algorithm can preserve the agents' private information from being leaked to honest-but-curious neighbors. Simulations further confirm the results.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08164v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"Two-and-a-half Order Score-based Model for Solving 3D Ill-posed Inverse Problems","description":"Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are crucial technologies in the field of medical imaging. Score-based models have proven to be effective in addressing different inverse problems encountered in CT and MRI, such as sparse-view CT and fast MRI reconstruction. However, these models face challenges in achieving accurate three dimensional (3D) volumetric reconstruction. The existing score-based models primarily focus on reconstructing two dimensional (2D) data distribution, leading to inconsistencies between adjacent slices in the reconstructed 3D volumetric images. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-and-a-half order score-based model (TOSM). During the training phase, our TOSM learns data distributions in 2D space, which reduces the complexity of training compared to directly working on 3D volumes. However, in the reconstruction phase, the TOSM updates the data distribution in 3D space, utilizing complementary scores along three directions (sagittal, coronal, and transaxial) to achieve a more precise reconstruction. The development of TOSM is built on robust theoretical principles, ensuring its reliability and efficacy. Through extensive experimentation on large-scale sparse-view CT and fast MRI datasets, our method demonstrates remarkable advancements and attains state-of-the-art results in solving 3D ill-posed inverse problems. Notably, the proposed TOSM effectively addresses the inter-slice inconsistency issue, resulting in high-quality 3D volumetric reconstruction.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08511v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

We compiled environmental and biological properties of the Phanerozoic Eon from various published data sets and conducted a correlation analysis to assess variations in parameters relevant to the habitability of Earth's biosphere. We showed that environmental parameters such as oxygen, global average surface temperatures, runoff rates and carbon dioxide are interrelated and play a key role in the changes of biomass and biodiversity. We showed that there were several periods with a highly thriving biosphere, with one even surpassing present day biodiversity and biomass. Those periods were characterized by increased oxygen levels and global runoff rates, as well as moderate global average surface temperatures, as long as no large or rapid positive and/or negative temperature excursions occurred. High oxygen contents are diagnostic of biomass production by continental plant life. We find that exceptionally high oxygen levels can at least in one instance compensate for decreased relative humidities, providing an even more habitable environment compared to today. Beyond Earth, these results will help us to understand how environmental parameters affect biospheres on extrasolar planets and guide us in our search for extraterrestrial life.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08470v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

{"title":"DeepContrast: Deep Tissue Contrast Enhancement using Synthetic Data Degradations and OOD Model Predictions","description":"Microscopy images are crucial for life science research, allowing detailed inspection and characterization of cellular and tissue-level structures and functions. However, microscopy data are unavoidably affected by image degradations, such as noise, blur, or others. Many such degradations also contribute to a loss of image contrast, which becomes especially pronounced in deeper regions of thick samples. Today, best performing methods to increase the quality of images are based on Deep Learning approaches, which typically require ground truth (GT) data during training. Our inability to counteract blurring and contrast loss when imaging deep into samples prevents the acquisition of such clean GT data. The fact that the forward process of blurring and contrast loss deep into tissue can be modeled, allowed us to propose a new method that can circumvent the problem of unobtainable GT data. To this end, we first synthetically degraded the quality of microscopy images even further by using an approximate forward model for deep tissue image degradations. Then we trained a neural network that learned the inverse of this degradation function from our generated pairs of raw and degraded images. We demonstrated that networks trained in this way can be used out-of-distribution (OOD) to improve the quality of less severely degraded images, e.g. the raw data imaged in a microscope. Since the absolute level of degradation in such microscopy images can be stronger than the additional degradation introduced by our forward model, we also explored the effect of iterative predictions. Here, we observed that in each iteration the measured image contrast kept improving while detailed structures in the images got increasingly removed. Therefore, dependent on the desired downstream analysis, a balance between contrast improvement and retention of image details has to be found.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08365v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Detoxify Language Model Step-by-Step","description":"Detoxification for LLMs is challenging since it requires models to avoid generating harmful content while maintaining the generation capability. To ensure the safety of generations, previous detoxification methods detoxify the models by changing the data distributions or constraining the generations from different aspects in a single-step manner. However, these approaches will dramatically affect the generation quality of LLMs, e.g., discourse coherence and semantic consistency, since language models tend to generate along the toxic prompt while detoxification methods work in the opposite direction. To handle such a conflict, we decompose the detoxification process into different sub-steps, where the detoxification is concentrated in the input stage and the subsequent continual generation is based on the non-toxic prompt. Besides, we also calibrate the strong reasoning ability of LLMs by designing a Detox-Chain to connect the above sub-steps in an orderly manner, which allows LLMs to detoxify the text step-by-step. Automatic and human evaluation on two benchmarks reveals that by training with Detox-Chain, six LLMs scaling from 1B to 33B can obtain significant detoxification and generation improvement.

{"title":"Explainable Multi-View Deep Networks Methodology for Experimental Physics","description":"Physical experiments often involve multiple imaging representations, such as X-ray scans and microscopic images. Deep learning models have been widely used for supervised analysis in these experiments. Combining different image representations is frequently required to analyze and make a decision properly. Consequently, multi-view data has emerged - datasets where each sample is described by views from different angles, sources, or modalities. These problems are addressed with the concept of multi-view learning. Understanding the decision-making process of deep learning models is essential for reliable and credible analysis. Hence, many explainability methods have been devised recently. Nonetheless, there is a lack of proper explainability in multi-view models, which are challenging to explain due to their architectures. In this paper, we suggest different multi-view architectures for the vision domain, each suited to another problem, and we also present a methodology for explaining these models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we focus on the domain of High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) experiments, where multiple imaging representations are used to assess the quality of foam samples. We apply our methodology to classify the foam samples quality using the suggested multi-view architectures. Through experimental results, we showcase the improvement of accurate architecture choice on both accuracy - 78% to 84% and AUC - 83% to 93% and present a trade-off between performance and explainability. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach enables the explanation of individual one-view models, providing insights into the decision-making process of each view. This understanding enhances the interpretability of the overall multi-view model.

{"title":"Deep Generative Imputation Model for Missing Not At Random Data","description":"Data analysis usually suffers from the Missing Not At Random (MNAR) problem, where the cause of the value missing is not fully observed. Compared to the naive Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) problem, it is more in line with the realistic scenario whereas more complex and challenging. Existing statistical methods model the MNAR mechanism by different decomposition of the joint distribution of the complete data and the missing mask. But we empirically find that directly incorporating these statistical methods into deep generative models is sub-optimal. Specifically, it would neglect the confidence of the reconstructed mask during the MNAR imputation process, which leads to insufficient information extraction and less-guaranteed imputation quality. In this paper, we revisit the MNAR problem from a novel perspective that the complete data and missing mask are two modalities of incomplete data on an equal footing. Along with this line, we put forward a generative-model-specific joint probability decomposition method, conjunction model, to represent the distributions of two modalities in parallel and extract sufficient information from both complete data and missing mask. Taking a step further, we exploit a deep generative imputation model, namely GNR, to process the real-world missing mechanism in the latent space and concurrently impute the incomplete data and reconstruct the missing mask. The experimental results show that our GNR surpasses state-of-the-art MNAR baselines with significant margins (averagely improved from 9.9% to 18.8% in RMSE) and always gives a better mask reconstruction accuracy which makes the imputation more principle.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08158v1","created":"2023-08-16","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
