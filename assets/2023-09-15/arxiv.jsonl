{"title":"Unified Human-Scene Interaction via Prompted Chain-of-Contacts","description":"Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

{"title":"mEBAL2 Database and Benchmark: Image-based Multispectral Eyeblink Detection","description":"This work introduces a new multispectral database and novel approaches for eyeblink detection in RGB and Near-Infrared (NIR) individual images. Our contributed dataset (mEBAL2, multimodal Eye Blink and Attention Level estimation, Version 2) is the largest existing eyeblink database, representing a great opportunity to improve data-driven multispectral approaches for blink detection and related applications (e.g., attention level estimation and presentation attack detection in face biometrics). mEBAL2 includes 21,100 image sequences from 180 different students (more than 2 million labeled images in total) while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty or taking a real course on HTML initiation through the edX MOOC platform. mEBAL2 uses multiple sensors, including two Near-Infrared (NIR) and one RGB camera to capture facial gestures during the execution of the tasks, as well as an Electroencephalogram (EEG) band to get the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events. Furthermore, this work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture as benchmark for blink detection on mEBAL2 with performances up to 97%. Different training methodologies are implemented using the RGB spectrum, NIR spectrum, and the combination of both to enhance the performance on existing eyeblink detectors. We demonstrate that combining NIR and RGB images during training improves the performance of RGB eyeblink detectors (i.e., detection based only on a RGB image). Finally, the generalization capacity of the proposed eyeblink detectors is validated in wilder and more challenging environments like the HUST-LEBW dataset to show the usefulness of mEBAL2 to train a new generation of data-driven approaches for eyeblink detection.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07880v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"MC-NeRF: Muti-Camera Neural Radiance Fields for Muti-Camera Image Acquisition Systems","description":"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) employ multi-view images for 3D scene representation and have shown remarkable performance. As one of the primary sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes. Most previous NeRF-based methods often assume a global unique camera and seldom consider scenarios with multiple cameras. Besides, some pose-robust methods still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when poses are poor initialized. In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method can jointly optimize both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields. Firstly, we conduct a theoretical analysis to tackle the degenerate case and coupling issue that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Secondly, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems, including the design of calibration object. Lastly, we present a global end-to-end network with training sequence that enables the regression of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network. Moreover, most existing datasets are designed for unique camera, we create a new dataset that includes four different styles of multi-camera acquisition systems, allowing readers to generate custom datasets. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method when each image corresponds to different camera parameters. Specifically, we adopt up to 110 images with 110 different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, to achieve 3D scene representation without providing initial poses.

{"title":"NineRec: A Benchmark Dataset Suite for Evaluating Transferable Recommendation","description":"Learning a recommender system model from an item's raw modality features (such as image, text, audio, etc.), called MoRec, has attracted growing interest recently. One key advantage of MoRec is that it can easily benefit from advances in other fields, such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Moreover, it naturally supports transfer learning across different systems through modality features, known as transferable recommender systems, or TransRec.   However, so far, TransRec has made little progress, compared to groundbreaking foundation models in the fields of NLP and CV. The lack of large-scale, high-quality recommendation datasets poses a major obstacle. To this end, we introduce NineRec, a TransRec dataset suite that includes a large-scale source domain recommendation dataset and nine diverse target domain recommendation datasets. Each item in NineRec is represented by a text description and a high-resolution cover image. With NineRec, we can implement TransRec models in an end-to-end training manner instead of using pre-extracted invariant features. We conduct a benchmark study and empirical analysis of TransRec using NineRec, and our findings provide several valuable insights. To support further research, we make our code, datasets, benchmarks, and leaderboards publicly available at https://github.com/anonymous?ninerec/NineRec.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07705v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Dataset Condensation via Generative Model","description":"Dataset condensation aims to condense a large dataset with a lot of training samples into a small set. Previous methods usually condense the dataset into the pixels format. However, it suffers from slow optimization speed and large number of parameters to be optimized. When increasing image resolutions and classes, the number of learnable parameters grows accordingly, prohibiting condensation methods from scaling up to large datasets with diverse classes. Moreover, the relations among condensed samples have been neglected and hence the feature distribution of condensed samples is often not diverse. To solve these problems, we propose to condense the dataset into another format, a generative model. Such a novel format allows for the condensation of large datasets because the size of the generative model remains relatively stable as the number of classes or image resolution increases. Furthermore, an intra-class and an inter-class loss are proposed to model the relation of condensed samples. Intra-class loss aims to create more diverse samples for each class by pushing each sample away from the others of the same class. Meanwhile, inter-class loss increases the discriminability of samples by widening the gap between the centers of different classes. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our method and its individual component. To our best knowledge, we are the first to successfully conduct condensation on ImageNet-1k.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07698v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients' distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep clients' data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other benchmarks in federated domain adaptation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07670v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

On the other hand, the second attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD. To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor, and Case Western Reserve University), where we show that, even with as little as 1 sample per class, one achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07666v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Dataset Size Dependence of Rate-Distortion Curve and Threshold of Posterior Collapse in Linear VAE","description":"In the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the variational posterior often aligns closely with the prior, which is known as posterior collapse and hinders the quality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable hyperparameter beta has been introduced in the VAE. This paper presents a closed-form expression to assess the relationship between the beta in VAE, the dataset size, the posterior collapse, and the rate-distortion curve by analyzing a minimal VAE in a high-dimensional limit. These results clarify that a long plateau in the generalization error emerges with a relatively larger beta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes infinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta, unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires careful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the rate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a rate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support our analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07663v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

In this paper, we created SIB-200 -- a large-scale open-sourced benchmark dataset for topic classification in 200 languages and dialects to address the lack of evaluation dataset for Natural Language Understanding (NLU). For many of the languages covered in SIB-200, this is the first publicly available evaluation dataset for NLU. The dataset is based on Flores-200 machine translation corpus. We annotated the English portion of the dataset and extended the sentence-level annotation to the remaining 203 languages covered in the corpus. Despite the simplicity of this task, our evaluation in full-supervised setting, cross-lingual transfer setting and prompting of large language model setting show that there is still a large gap between the performance of high-resource and low-resource languages when multilingual evaluation is scaled to numerous world languages. We found that languages unseen during the pre-training of multilingual language models, under-represented language families (like Nilotic and Altantic-Congo), and languages from the regions of Africa, Americas, Oceania and South East Asia, often have the lowest performance on our topic classification dataset. We hope our dataset will encourage a more inclusive evaluation of multilingual language models on a more diverse set of languages. https://github.com/dadelani/sib-200","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07445v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Physical Invisible Backdoor Based on Camera Imaging","description":"Backdoor attack aims to compromise a model, which returns an adversary-wanted output when a specific trigger pattern appears yet behaves normally for clean inputs. Current backdoor attacks require changing pixels of clean images, which results in poor stealthiness of attacks and increases the difficulty of the physical implementation. This paper proposes a novel physical invisible backdoor based on camera imaging without changing nature image pixels. Specifically, a compromised model returns a target label for images taken by a particular camera, while it returns correct results for other images. To implement and evaluate the proposed backdoor, we take shots of different objects from multi-angles using multiple smartphones to build a new dataset of 21,500 images. Conventional backdoor attacks work ineffectively with some classical models, such as ResNet18, over the above-mentioned dataset. Therefore, we propose a three-step training strategy to mount the backdoor attack. First, we design and train a camera identification model with the phone IDs to extract the camera fingerprint feature. Subsequently, we elaborate a special network architecture, which is easily compromised by our backdoor attack, by leveraging the attributes of the CFA interpolation algorithm and combining it with the feature extraction block in the camera identification model. Finally, we transfer the backdoor from the elaborated special network architecture to the classical architecture model via teacher-student distillation learning. Since the trigger of our method is related to the specific phone, our attack works effectively in the physical world. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach and robustness against various backdoor defenses.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07428v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"Applying Deep Learning to Calibrate Stochastic Volatility Models","description":"Stochastic volatility models, where the volatility is a stochastic process, can capture most of the essential stylized facts of implied volatility surfaces and give more realistic dynamics of the volatility smile or skew. However, they come with the significant issue that they take too long to calibrate.   Alternative calibration methods based on Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been recently used to build fast and accurate solutions to the calibration problem. Huge and Savine developed a Differential Deep Learning (DDL) approach, where Machine Learning models are trained on samples of not only features and labels but also differentials of labels to features. The present work aims to apply the DDL technique to price vanilla European options (i.e. the calibration instruments), more specifically, puts when the underlying asset follows a Heston model and then calibrate the model on the trained network. DDL allows for fast training and accurate pricing. The trained neural network dramatically reduces Heston calibration's computation time.   In this work, we also introduce different regularisation techniques, and we apply them notably in the case of the DDL. We compare their performance in reducing overfitting and improving the generalisation error. The DDL performance is also compared to the classical DL (without differentiation) one in the case of Feed-Forward Neural Networks. We show that the DDL outperforms the DL.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07843v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

The trained policy is not always compliant with the traffic rules and it is also hard to discover the reason for the misbehavior because of the lack of intermediate outputs.

{"title":"AIDPS:Adaptive Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","description":"Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) are predominantly used for underwater environments and find applications in many areas. However, a lack of security considerations, the unstable and challenging nature of the underwater environment, and the resource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes used for UW-ASNs (which makes them incapable of adopting security primitives) make the UW-ASN prone to vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an Adaptive decentralised Intrusion Detection and Prevention System called AIDPS for UW-ASNs. The proposed AIDPS can improve the security of the UW-ASNs so that they can efficiently detect underwater-related attacks (e.g., blackhole, grayhole and flooding attacks). To determine the most effective configuration of the proposed construction, we conduct a number of experiments using several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., Adaptive Random Forest (ARF), light gradient-boosting machine, and K-nearest neighbours) and concept drift detection algorithms (e.g., ADWIN, kdqTree, and Page-Hinkley). Our experimental results show that incremental ARF using ADWIN provides optimal performance when implemented with One-class support vector machine (SVM) anomaly-based detectors. Furthermore, our extensive evaluation results also show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art bench-marking methods while providing a wider range of desirable features such as scalability and complexity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07730v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"Semantic Adversarial Attacks via Diffusion Models","description":"Traditional adversarial attacks concentrate on manipulating clean examples in the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples, such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models. Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation (ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and transferability compared to other baselines.

{"title":"PRE: Vision-Language Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder","description":"Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes. Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of 5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07760v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}

Here, we report on the controlled focused ion beam in-situ deposition of a thin metal film on specimens immediately after specimen preparation. Different metallic targets e.g. Cr were attached to a micromanipulator via a conventional lift-out method and sputtered using the Ga or Xe ions. We showcase the many advantages of coating specimens from metallic to non-metallic materials. We have identified an increase in data quality and yield, an improvement of the mass resolution, as well as an increase in the effective field-of-view enabling visualization of the entire original specimen, including the complete surface oxide layer. The ease of implementation of the approach makes it very attractive for generalizing its use across a very wide range of atom probe analyses.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07836v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Pop Quiz! Do Pre-trained Code Models Possess Knowledge of Correct API Names?","description":"Recent breakthroughs in pre-trained code models, such as CodeBERT and Codex, have shown their superior performance in various downstream tasks. The correctness and unambiguity of API usage among these code models are crucial for achieving desirable program functionalities, requiring them to learn various API fully qualified names structurally and semantically. Recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art pre-trained code models struggle with suggesting the correct APIs during code generation. However, the reasons for such poor API usage performance are barely investigated. To address this challenge, we propose using knowledge probing as a means of interpreting code models, which uses cloze-style tests to measure the knowledge stored in models. Our comprehensive study examines a code model's capability of understanding API fully qualified names from two different perspectives: API call and API import. Specifically, we reveal that current code models struggle with understanding API names, with pre-training strategies significantly affecting the quality of API name learning. We demonstrate that natural language context can assist code models in locating Python API names and generalize Python API name knowledge to unseen data. Our findings provide insights into the limitations and capabilities of current pre-trained code models, and suggest that incorporating API structure into the pre-training process can improve automated API usage and code representations. This work provides significance for advancing code intelligence practices and direction for future studies.

{"title":"SnakeGAN: A Universal Vocoder Leveraging DDSP Prior Knowledge and Periodic Inductive Bias","description":"Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based neural vocoders have been widely used in audio synthesis tasks due to their high generation quality, efficient inference, and small computation footprint. However, it is still challenging to train a universal vocoder which can generalize well to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, such as unseen speaking styles, non-speech vocalization, singing, and musical pieces. In this work, we propose SnakeGAN, a GAN-based universal vocoder, which can synthesize high-fidelity audio in various OOD scenarios. SnakeGAN takes a coarse-grained signal generated by a differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) model as prior knowledge, aiming at recovering high-fidelity waveform from a Mel-spectrogram. We introduce periodic nonlinearities through the Snake activation function and anti-aliased representation into the generator, which further brings the desired inductive bias for audio synthesis and significantly improves the extrapolation capacity for universal vocoding in unseen scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we train SnakeGAN with only speech data and evaluate its performance for various OOD distributions with both subjective and objective metrics. Experimental results show that SnakeGAN significantly outperforms the compared approaches and can generate high-fidelity audio samples including unseen speakers with unseen styles, singing voices, instrumental pieces, and nonverbal vocalization.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07803v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"NutritionVerse: Empirical Study of Various Dietary Intake Estimation Approaches","description":"Accurate dietary intake estimation is critical for informing policies and programs to support healthy eating, as malnutrition has been directly linked to decreased quality of life. However self-reporting methods such as food diaries suffer from substantial bias. Other conventional dietary assessment techniques and emerging alternative approaches such as mobile applications incur high time costs and may necessitate trained personnel. Recent work has focused on using computer vision and machine learning to automatically estimate dietary intake from food images, but the lack of comprehensive datasets with diverse viewpoints, modalities and food annotations hinders the accuracy and realism of such methods. To address this limitation, we introduce NutritionVerse-Synth, the first large-scale dataset of 84,984 photorealistic synthetic 2D food images with associated dietary information and multimodal annotations (including depth images, instance masks, and semantic masks). Additionally, we collect a real image dataset, NutritionVerse-Real, containing 889 images of 251 dishes to evaluate realism. Leveraging these novel datasets, we develop and benchmark NutritionVerse, an empirical study of various dietary intake estimation approaches, including indirect segmentation-based and direct prediction networks. We further fine-tune models pretrained on synthetic data with real images to provide insights into the fusion of synthetic and real data. Finally, we release both datasets (NutritionVerse-Synth, NutritionVerse-Real) on https://www.kaggle.com/nutritionverse/datasets as part of an open initiative to accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07704v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from MEG signals","description":"Decoding language from neural signals holds considerable theoretical and practical importance. Previous research has indicated the feasibility of decoding text or speech from invasive neural signals. However, when using non-invasive neural signals, significant challenges are encountered due to their low quality. In this study, we proposed a data-driven approach for decoding semantic of language from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals recorded while subjects were listening to continuous speech. First, a multi-subject decoding model was trained using contrastive learning to reconstruct continuous word embeddings from MEG data. Subsequently, a beam search algorithm was adopted to generate text sequences based on the reconstructed word embeddings. Given a candidate sentence in the beam, a language model was used to predict the subsequent words. The word embeddings of the subsequent words were correlated with the reconstructed word embedding. These correlations were then used as a measure of the probability for the next word. The results showed that the proposed continuous word embedding model can effectively leverage both subject-specific and subject-shared information. Additionally, the decoded text exhibited significant similarity to the target text, with an average BERTScore of 0.816, a score comparable to that in the previous fMRI study.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07701v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Aligning Speakers: Evaluating and Visualizing Text-based Diarization Using Efficient Multiple Sequence Alignment (Extended Version)","description":"This paper presents a novel evaluation approach to text-based speaker diarization (SD), tackling the limitations of traditional metrics that do not account for any contextual information in text. Two new metrics are proposed, Text-based Diarization Error Rate and Diarization F1, which perform utterance- and word-level evaluations by aligning tokens in reference and hypothesis transcripts. Our metrics encompass more types of errors compared to existing ones, allowing us to make a more comprehensive analysis in SD. To align tokens, a multiple sequence alignment algorithm is introduced that supports multiple sequences in the reference while handling high-dimensional alignment to the hypothesis using dynamic programming. Our work is packaged into two tools, align4d providing an API for our alignment algorithm and TranscribeView for visualizing and evaluating SD errors, which can greatly aid in the creation of high-quality data, fostering the advancement of dialogue systems.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07677v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"SwitchGPT: Adapting Large Language Models for Non-Text Outputs","description":"Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily trained on text-based datasets, exhibit exceptional proficiencies in understanding and executing complex linguistic instructions via text outputs. However, they falter when requests to generate non-text ones. Concurrently, modality conversion models, such as text-to-image, despite generating high-quality images, suffer from a lack of extensive textual pretraining. As a result, these models are only capable of accommodating specific image descriptions rather than comprehending more complex instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach, \\methodname, from a modality conversion perspective that evolves a text-based LLM into a multi-modal one. We specifically employ a minimal dataset to instruct LLMs to recognize the intended output modality as directed by the instructions. Consequently, the adapted LLM can effectively summon various off-the-shelf modality conversion models from the model zoos to generate non-text responses. This circumvents the necessity for complicated pretraining that typically requires immense quantities of paired multi-modal data, while simultaneously inheriting the extensive knowledge of LLMs and the ability of high-quality generative models. To evaluate and compare the adapted multi-modal LLM with its traditional counterparts, we have constructed a multi-modal instruction benchmark that solicits diverse modality outputs. The experiment results reveal that, with minimal training, LLMs can be conveniently adapted to comprehend requests for non-text responses, thus achieving higher flexibility in multi-modal scenarios.

{"title":"Learning Quasi-Static 3D Models of Markerless Deformable Linear Objects for Bimanual Robotic Manipulation","description":"The robotic manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is a vital and challenging task that is important in many practical applications. Classical model-based approaches to this problem require an accurate model to capture how robot motions affect the deformation of the DLO. Nowadays, data-driven models offer the best tradeoff between quality and computation time. This paper analyzes several learning-based 3D models of the DLO and proposes a new one based on the Transformer architecture that achieves superior accuracy, even on the DLOs of different lengths, thanks to the proposed scaling method. Moreover, we introduce a data augmentation technique, which improves the prediction performance of almost all considered DLO data-driven models. Thanks to this technique, even a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves close to state-of-the-art performance while being significantly faster to evaluate. In the experiments, we compare the performance of the learning-based 3D models of the DLO on several challenging datasets quantitatively and demonstrate their applicability in the task of shaping a DLO.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07609v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Revisiting Supertagging for HPSG","description":"We present new supertaggers trained on HPSG-based treebanks. These treebanks feature high-quality annotation based on a well-developed linguistic theory and include diverse and challenging test datasets, beyond the usual WSJ section 23 and Wikipedia data. HPSG supertagging has previously relied on MaxEnt-based models. We use SVM and neural CRF- and BERT-based methods and show that both SVM and neural supertaggers achieve considerably higher accuracy compared to the baseline. Our fine-tuned BERT-based tagger achieves 97.26% accuracy on 1000 sentences from WSJ23 and 93.88% on the completely out-of-domain The Cathedral and the Bazaar (cb)). We conclude that it therefore makes sense to integrate these new supertaggers into modern HPSG parsers, and we also hope that the diverse and difficult datasets we used here will gain more popularity in the field. We contribute the complete dataset reformatted for token classification.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07590v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete-Unit-Based Style Transfer","description":"Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) with discrete self-supervised representations has achieved remarkable accuracy, but is unable to preserve the speaker timbre of the source speech during translation. Meanwhile, the scarcity of high-quality speaker-parallel data poses a challenge for learning style transfer between source and target speech. We propose an S2ST framework with an acoustic language model based on discrete units from a self-supervised model and a neural codec for style transfer. The acoustic language model leverages self-supervised in-context learning, acquiring the ability for style transfer without relying on any speaker-parallel data, thereby overcoming the issue of data scarcity. By using extensive training data, our model achieves zero-shot cross-lingual style transfer on previously unseen source languages. Experiments show that our model generates translated speeches with high fidelity and style similarity.

{"title":"A Multi-scale Generalized Shrinkage Threshold Network for Image Blind Deblurring in Remote Sensing","description":"Remote sensing images are essential for many earth science applications, but their quality can be degraded due to limitations in sensor technology and complex imaging environments. To address this, various remote sensing image deblurring methods have been developed to restore sharp, high-quality images from degraded observational data. However, most traditional model-based deblurring methods usually require predefined hand-craft prior assumptions, which are difficult to handle in complex applications, and most deep learning-based deblurring methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel blind deblurring learning framework based on alternating iterations of shrinkage thresholds, alternately updating blurring kernels and images, with the theoretical foundation of network design. Additionally, we propose a learnable blur kernel proximal mapping module to improve the blur kernel evaluation in the kernel domain. Then, we proposed a deep proximal mapping module in the image domain, which combines a generalized shrinkage threshold operator and a multi-scale prior feature extraction block. This module also introduces an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the prior importance, thus avoiding the drawbacks of hand-crafted image prior terms. Thus, a novel multi-scale generalized shrinkage threshold network (MGSTNet) is designed to specifically focus on learning deep geometric prior features to enhance image restoration. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our MGSTNet framework on remote sensing image datasets compared to existing deblurring methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07524v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"A Tutorial on Environment-Aware Communications via Channel Knowledge Map for 6G","description":"Sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to have dense infrastructures, large-dimensional channels, cost-effective hardware, diversified positioning methods, and enhanced intelligence. Such trends bring both new challenges and opportunities for the practical design of 6G. On one hand, acquiring channel state information (CSI) in real time for all wireless links becomes quite challenging in 6G. On the other hand, there would be numerous data sources in 6G containing high-quality location-tagged channel data, making it possible to better learn the local wireless environment. By exploiting such new opportunities and for tackling the CSI acquisition challenge, there is a promising paradigm shift from the conventional environment-unaware communications to the new environment-aware communications based on the novel approach of channel knowledge map (CKM). This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview on environment-aware communications enabled by CKM to fully harness its benefits for 6G. First, the basic concept of CKM is presented, and a comparison of CKM with various existing channel inference techniques is discussed. Next, the main techniques for CKM construction are discussed, including both the model-free and model-assisted approaches. Furthermore, a general framework is presented for the utilization of CKM to achieve environment-aware communications, followed by some typical CKM-aided communication scenarios. Finally, important open problems in CKM research are highlighted and potential solutions are discussed to inspire future work.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07460v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Supporting Management of Gestational Diabetes with Comprehensive Self-Tracking: Mixed-Method Study of Wearable Sensors","description":"Gestational diabetes (GDM) poses a growing health risk to both pregnant women and their offspring. While telehealth interventions for GDM management have proven effective, they have traditionally relied on healthcare professionals for guidance and feedback. Our aim was to explore self-tracking in GDM with wearable sensors from self-discovery (i.e., learning associations between glucose levels and lifestyle) and user experience perspectives. We conducted a mixed-methods study with women diagnosed with GDM, utilizing continuous glucose monitor and three types of physical activity sensors (activity bracelet, hip-worn sensor, and electrocardiography sensor) for a week. Data from the sensors was collected, and participants were later interviewed about their experience with the wearable sensors. Additionally, we gathered maternal nutrition data through a 3-day food diary and recorded self-reported physical activity using a logbook. We discovered that continuous glucose monitors were especially valuable for self-discovery, particularly when establishing links between glucose levels and nutritional intake. Challenges associated with using wearable sensors data for self-discovery in GDM included: (1) Separation of glucose and physical activity data in different applications, (2) Missing key trackable features, such as light physical activity and non-walking activities, (3) Discrepancies in data, and (4) Differences in perceived versus measured physical activity. The placement of sensors on the body emerged as a critical factor influencing data quality and personal preferences. To conclude, an app where glucose, nutrition, and physical activity data are combined is needed to support self-discovery. This app should enable tracking of essential features for women with GDM, including light physical activity, with data originating from a single sensor to ensure consistency and eliminate redundancy.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07437v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"JSMNet Improving Indoor Point Cloud Semantic and Instance Segmentation through Self-Attention and Multiscale","description":"The semantic understanding of indoor 3D point cloud data is crucial for a range of subsequent applications, including indoor service robots, navigation systems, and digital twin engineering. Global features are crucial for achieving high-quality semantic and instance segmentation of indoor point clouds, as they provide essential long-range context information. To this end, we propose JSMNet, which combines a multi-layer network with a global feature self-attention module to jointly segment three-dimensional point cloud semantics and instances. To better express the characteristics of indoor targets, we have designed a multi-resolution feature adaptive fusion module that takes into account the differences in point cloud density caused by varying scanner distances from the target. Additionally, we propose a framework for joint semantic and instance segmentation by integrating semantic and instance features to achieve superior results. We conduct experiments on S3DIS, which is a large three-dimensional indoor point cloud dataset. Our proposed method is compared against other methods, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in semantic and instance segmentation and provides better results in target local area segmentation. Specifically, our proposed method outperforms PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) by 16.0% and 26.3% in terms of semantic segmentation mIoU in S3DIS (Area 5) and instance segmentation mPre, respectively. Additionally, it surpasses ASIS (Wang et al., 2019) by 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively, as well as JSPNet (Chen et al., 2022) by a margin of 3.3% for semantic segmentation mIoU and a slight improvement of 0.3% for instance segmentation mPre.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07425v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"DebCSE: Rethinking Unsupervised Contrastive Sentence Embedding Learning in the Debiasing Perspective","description":"Several prior studies have suggested that word frequency biases can cause the Bert model to learn indistinguishable sentence embeddings. Contrastive learning schemes such as SimCSE and ConSERT have already been adopted successfully in unsupervised sentence embedding to improve the quality of embeddings by reducing this bias. However, these methods still introduce new biases such as sentence length bias and false negative sample bias, that hinders model's ability to learn more fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we reexamine the challenges of contrastive sentence embedding learning from a debiasing perspective and argue that effectively eliminating the influence of various biases is crucial for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. We think all those biases are introduced by simple rules for constructing training data in contrastive learning and the key for contrastive learning sentence embedding is to mimic the distribution of training data in supervised machine learning in unsupervised way. We propose a novel contrastive framework for sentence embedding, termed DebCSE, which can eliminate the impact of these biases by an inverse propensity weighted sampling method to select high-quality positive and negative pairs according to both the surface and semantic similarity between sentences. Extensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmarks reveal that DebCSE significantly outperforms the latest state-of-the-art models with an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 80.33% on BERTbase.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07396v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream. We validate our approach using a custom-built data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our preliminary evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates well over 80%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by six orders of magnitude.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07361v1","created":"2023-09-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
