{"title":"Asymmetric $X$-Secure $T$-Private Information Retrieval: More Databases is Not Always Better","description":"We consider a special case of $X$-secure $T$-private information retrieval (XSTPIR), where the security requirement is \\emph{asymmetric} due to possible missing communication links between the $N$ databases considered in the system. We define the problem with a communication matrix that indicates all possible communications among the databases, and propose a database grouping mechanism that collects subsets of databases in an optimal manner, followed by a group-based PIR scheme to perform asymmetric XSTPIR with the goal of maximizing the communication rate (minimizing the download cost). We provide an upper bound on the general achievable rate of asymmetric XSTPIR, and show that the proposed scheme achieves this upper bound in some cases. The proposed approach outperforms classical XSTPIR under certain conditions, and the results of this work show that unlike in the symmetric case, some databases with certain properties can be dropped to achieve higher rates, concluding that more databases is not always better.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05649v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

However, current research focuses on publicly available datasets which have only the question field and significantly differ from real-life datasets. This paper proposes methods to improve the intent discovery pipeline deployed in a large e-commerce platform. We show the benefit of pre-training language models on in-domain data: both self-supervised and with weak supervision. We also devise the best method to utilize the conversational structure (i.e., question and answer) of real-life datasets during fine-tuning for clustering tasks, which we call Conv. All our methods combined to fully utilize real-life datasets give up to 33pp performance boost over state-of-the-art Constrained Deep Adaptive Clustering (CDAC) model for question only.

{"title":"Eiffel Tower: A Deep-Sea Underwater Dataset for Long-Term Visual Localization","description":"Visual localization plays an important role in the positioning and navigation of robotics systems within previously visited environments. When visits occur over long periods of time, changes in the environment related to seasons or day-night cycles present a major challenge. Under water, the sources of variability are due to other factors such as water conditions or growth of marine organisms. Yet it remains a major obstacle and a much less studied one, partly due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new deep-sea dataset to benchmark underwater long-term visual localization. The dataset is composed of images from four visits to the same hydrothermal vent edifice over the course of five years. Camera poses and a common geometry of the scene were estimated using navigation data and Structure-from-Motion. This serves as a reference when evaluating visual localization techniques. An analysis of the data provides insights about the major changes observed throughout the years. Furthermore, several well-established visual localization methods are evaluated on the dataset, showing there is still room for improvement in underwater long-term visual localization.

{"title":"SUR-adapter: Enhancing Text-to-Image Pre-trained Diffusion Models with Large Language Models","description":"Diffusion models, which have emerged to become popular text-to-image generation models, can produce high-quality and content-rich images guided by textual prompts. However, there are limitations to semantic understanding and commonsense reasoning in existing models when the input prompts are concise narrative, resulting in low-quality image generation. To improve the capacities for narrative prompts, we propose a simple-yet-effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called the Semantic Understanding and Reasoning adapter (SUR-adapter) for pre-trained diffusion models. To reach this goal, we first collect and annotate a new dataset SURD which consists of more than 57,000 semantically corrected multi-modal samples. Each sample contains a simple narrative prompt, a complex keyword-based prompt, and a high-quality image. Then, we align the semantic representation of narrative prompts to the complex prompts and transfer knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to our SUR-adapter via knowledge distillation so that it can acquire the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities to build a high-quality textual semantic representation for text-to-image generation. We conduct experiments by integrating multiple LLMs and popular pre-trained diffusion models to show the effectiveness of our approach in enabling diffusion models to understand and reason concise natural language without image quality degradation. Our approach can make text-to-image diffusion models easier to use with better user experience, which demonstrates our approach has the potential for further advancing the development of user-friendly text-to-image generation models by bridging the semantic gap between simple narrative prompts and complex keyword-based prompts.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05189v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

In contrast, little attention has been paid to the complicated problem of Chinese Semantic Error Diagnosis (CSED), which lacks relevant datasets. The study of semantic errors is important because they are very common and may lead to syntactic irregularities or even problems of comprehension. To investigate this, we build the CSED corpus, which includes two datasets. The one is for the CSED-Recognition (CSED-R) task. The other is for the CSED-Correction (CSED-C) task. Our annotation guarantees high-quality data through quality assurance mechanisms. Our experiments show that powerful pre-trained models perform poorly on this corpus. We also find that the CSED task is challenging, as evidenced by the fact that even humans receive a low score. This paper proposes syntax-aware models to specifically adapt to the CSED task.

Inspired by group testing, the framework leverages overlapping groups of clients to detect the presence of malicious clients in the groups and to identify them via a decoding operation. The identified clients are then removed from the training of the model, which is performed over the remaining clients. FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security, allowing for improved identification capabilities while still preserving data privacy. Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in each group. The effectiveness of FedGT is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing its ability to identify malicious clients with low misdetection and false alarm probabilities, resulting in high model utility.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05506v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

These models have become essential in signifying the capabilities of AI and supporting vital services like national postal operations. However, the performance of OR models can be impeded by real-life scenarios, such as traffic sign alteration. Therefore, this research investigates the effects of altered traffic signs on the accuracy and performance of object recognition models. To this end, a publicly available dataset was used to create different types of traffic sign alterations, including changes to size, shape, color, visibility, and angles. The impact of these alterations on the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) model's detection and classification abilities were analyzed. It reveals that the accuracy of object detection models decreases significantly when exposed to modified traffic signs under unlikely conditions. This study highlights the significance of enhancing the robustness of object detection models in real-life scenarios and the need for further investigation in this area to improve their accuracy and reliability.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05499v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Turning Privacy-preserving Mechanisms against Federated Learning","description":"Recently, researchers have successfully employed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build enhanced recommender systems due to their capability to learn patterns from the interaction between involved entities. In addition, previous studies have investigated federated learning as the main solution to enable a native privacy-preserving mechanism for the construction of global GNN models without collecting sensitive data into a single computation unit. Still, privacy issues may arise as the analysis of local model updates produced by the federated clients can return information related to sensitive local data. For this reason, experts proposed solutions that combine federated learning with Differential Privacy strategies and community-driven approaches, which involve combining data from neighbor clients to make the individual local updates less dependent on local sensitive data. In this paper, we identify a crucial security flaw in such a configuration, and we design an attack capable of deceiving state-of-the-art defenses for federated learning. The proposed attack includes two operating modes, the first one focusing on convergence inhibition (Adversarial Mode), and the second one aiming at building a deceptive rating injection on the global federated model (Backdoor Mode). The experimental results show the effectiveness of our attack in both its modes, returning on average 60% performance detriment in all the tests on Adversarial Mode and fully effective backdoors in 93% of cases for the tests performed on Backdoor Mode.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05355v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"On the Limitations of Model Stealing with Uncertainty Quantification Models","description":"Model stealing aims at inferring a victim model's functionality at a fraction of the original training cost. While the goal is clear, in practice the model's architecture, weight dimension, and original training data can not be determined exactly, leading to mutual uncertainty during stealing. In this work, we explicitly tackle this uncertainty by generating multiple possible networks and combining their predictions to improve the quality of the stolen model. For this, we compare five popular uncertainty quantification models in a model stealing task. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the considered models only lead to marginal improvements in terms of label agreement (i.e., fidelity) to the stolen model. To find the cause of this, we inspect the diversity of the model's prediction by looking at the prediction variance as a function of training iterations. We realize that during training, the models tend to have similar predictions, indicating that the network diversity we wanted to leverage using uncertainty quantification models is not (high) enough for improvements on the model stealing task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05293v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"PET-NeuS: Positional Encoding Tri-Planes for Neural Surfaces","description":"A signed distance function (SDF) parametrized by an MLP is a common ingredient of neural surface reconstruction. We build on the successful recent method NeuS to extend it by three new components. The first component is to borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the reconstruction process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features with different frequency bands. The experiments show that PET-NeuS achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous work and using the Chamfer metric as the most important way to measure surface reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon the NeuS baseline by 57% on Nerf-synthetic (0.84 compared to 1.97) and by 15.5% on DTU (0.71 compared to 0.84).

Product data quality is affected by missing or incorrect information resulting in poor customer experience. While machine learning can be used to correct inaccurate or missing information, achieving high performance on fashion image classification tasks requires large amounts of annotated data, but it is expensive to generate due to labeling costs. One solution can be to generate synthetic data which requires no manual labeling. However, training a model with a dataset of solely synthetic images can lead to poor generalization when performing inference on real-world data because of the domain shift. We introduce a new unsupervised domain adaptation technique that converts images from the synthetic domain into the real-world domain. Our approach combines a generative neural network and a classifier that are jointly trained to produce realistic images while preserving the synthetic label information. We found that using real-world pseudo-labels during training helps the classifier to generalize in the real-world domain, reducing the synthetic bias. We successfully train a visual pattern classification model in the fashion domain without real-world annotations. Experiments show that our method outperforms other unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05580v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

We explore the design space of such models, comparing architectural innovations and a variety of different pretraining objectives on a suite of evaluation tasks with a fixed training procedure in order to find the currently optimal way to build and train character-level BERT-like models. We find that our best performing character-level model exceeds the performance of a token-based model trained with the same settings on the same data, suggesting that character-level models are ready for more widespread adoption. Unfortunately, the best method to train character-level models still relies on a subword-level tokeniser during pretraining, and final model performance is highly dependent on tokeniser quality. We believe our results demonstrate the readiness of character-level models for multilingual language representation, and encourage NLP practitioners to try them as drop-in replacements for token-based models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05461v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"StyleSync: High-Fidelity Generalized and Personalized Lip Sync in Style-based Generator","description":"Despite recent advances in syncing lip movements with any audio waves, current methods still struggle to balance generation quality and the model's generalization ability. Previous studies either require long-term data for training or produce a similar movement pattern on all subjects with low quality. In this paper, we propose StyleSync, an effective framework that enables high-fidelity lip synchronization. We identify that a style-based generator would sufficiently enable such a charming property on both one-shot and few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we design a mask-guided spatial information encoding module that preserves the details of the given face. The mouth shapes are accurately modified by audio through modulated convolutions. Moreover, our design also enables personalized lip-sync by introducing style space and generator refinement on only limited frames. Thus the identity and talking style of a target person could be accurately preserved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity results on a variety of scenes.

{"title":"Fast Many-to-Many Routing for Ridesharing with Multiple Pickup and Dropoff Locations","description":"We introduce KaRRi, an improved algorithm for scheduling a fleet of shared vehicles as it is used by services like UberXShare and Lyft Shared. We speed up the basic online algorithm that looks for all possible insertions of a new customer into a set of existing routes, we generalize the objective function, and efficiently support a large number of possible pick-up and drop-off locations. This lays an algorithmic foundation for ridesharing systems with higher vehicle occupancy -- enabling greatly reduced cost and ecological impact at comparable service quality. We find that our algorithm computes assignments between vehicles and riders several times faster than a previous state-of-the-art approach. Further, we observe that allowing meeting points for vehicles and riders can reduce the operating cost of vehicle fleets by up to $15\\%$ while also reducing passenger wait and trip times.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05417v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Completeness, Recall, and Negation in Open-World Knowledge Bases: A Survey","description":"General-purpose knowledge bases (KBs) are a cornerstone of knowledge-centric AI. Many of them are constructed pragmatically from Web sources, and are thus far from complete. This poses challenges for the consumption as well as the curation of their content. While several surveys target the problem of completing incomplete KBs, the first problem is arguably to know whether and where the KB is incomplete in the first place, and to which degree.   In this survey we discuss how knowledge about completeness, recall, and negation in KBs can be expressed, extracted, and inferred. We cover (i) the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics; (ii) the estimation of this information via statistical patterns; (iii) the extraction of information about recall from KBs and text; (iv) the identification of interesting negative statements; and (v) relaxed notions of relative recall.   This survey is targeted at two types of audiences: (1) practitioners who are interested in tracking KB quality, focusing extraction efforts, and building quality-aware downstream applications; and (2) data management, knowledge base and semantic web researchers who wish to understand the state of the art of knowledge bases beyond the open-world assumption. Consequently, our survey presents both fundamental methodologies and their working, and gives practice-oriented recommendations on how to choose between different approaches for a problem at hand.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05403v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"CaseEncoder: A Knowledge-enhanced Pre-trained Model for Legal Case Encoding","description":"Legal case retrieval is a critical process for modern legal information systems. While recent studies have utilized pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on the general domain self-supervised pre-training paradigm to build models for legal case retrieval, there are limitations in using general domain PLMs as backbones. Specifically, these models may not fully capture the underlying legal features in legal case documents. To address this issue, we propose CaseEncoder, a legal document encoder that leverages fine-grained legal knowledge in both the data sampling and pre-training phases. In the data sampling phase, we enhance the quality of the training data by utilizing fine-grained law article information to guide the selection of positive and negative examples. In the pre-training phase, we design legal-specific pre-training tasks that align with the judging criteria of relevant legal cases. Based on these tasks, we introduce an innovative loss function called Biased Circle Loss to enhance the model's ability to recognize case relevance in fine grains. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CaseEncoder significantly outperforms both existing general pre-training models and legal-specific pre-training models in zero-shot legal case retrieval.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05393v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Safe Deep RL for Intraoperative Planning of Pedicle Screw Placement","description":"Spinal fusion surgery requires highly accurate implantation of pedicle screw implants, which must be conducted in critical proximity to vital structures with a limited view of anatomy. Robotic surgery systems have been proposed to improve placement accuracy, however, state-of-the-art systems suffer from the limitations of open-loop approaches, as they follow traditional concepts of preoperative planning and intraoperative registration, without real-time recalculation of the surgical plan. In this paper, we propose an intraoperative planning approach for robotic spine surgery that leverages real-time observation for drill path planning based on Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The main contributions of our method are (1) the capability to guarantee safe actions by introducing an uncertainty-aware distance-based safety filter; and (2) the ability to compensate for incomplete intraoperative anatomical information, by encoding a-priori knowledge about anatomical structures with a network pre-trained on high-fidelity anatomical models. Planning quality was assessed by quantitative comparison with the gold standard (GS) drill planning. In experiments with 5 models derived from real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, our approach was capable of achieving 90% bone penetration with respect to the GS while satisfying safety requirements, even under observation and motion uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first safe DRL approach focusing on orthopedic surgeries.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05354v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"On the Limitations of Model Stealing with Uncertainty Quantification Models","description":"Model stealing aims at inferring a victim model's functionality at a fraction of the original training cost. While the goal is clear, in practice the model's architecture, weight dimension, and original training data can not be determined exactly, leading to mutual uncertainty during stealing. In this work, we explicitly tackle this uncertainty by generating multiple possible networks and combining their predictions to improve the quality of the stolen model. For this, we compare five popular uncertainty quantification models in a model stealing task. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the considered models only lead to marginal improvements in terms of label agreement (i.e., fidelity) to the stolen model. To find the cause of this, we inspect the diversity of the model's prediction by looking at the prediction variance as a function of training iterations. We realize that during training, the models tend to have similar predictions, indicating that the network diversity we wanted to leverage using uncertainty quantification models is not (high) enough for improvements on the model stealing task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05293v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Fooling State-of-the-Art Deepfake Detection with High-Quality Deepfakes","description":"Due to the rising threat of deepfakes to security and privacy, it is most important to develop robust and reliable detectors. In this paper, we examine the need for high-quality samples in the training datasets of such detectors. Accordingly, we show that deepfake detectors proven to generalize well on multiple research datasets still struggle in real-world scenarios with well-crafted fakes. First, we propose a novel autoencoder for face swapping alongside an advanced face blending technique, which we utilize to generate 90 high-quality deepfakes. Second, we feed those fakes to a state-of-the-art detector, causing its performance to decrease drastically. Moreover, we fine-tune the detector on our fakes and demonstrate that they contain useful clues for the detection of manipulations. Overall, our results provide insights into the generalization of deepfake detectors and suggest that their training datasets should be complemented by high-quality fakes since training on mere research data is insufficient.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05282v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"CSED: A Chinese Semantic Error Diagnosis Corpus","description":"Recently, much Chinese text error correction work has focused on Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) and Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED). In contrast, little attention has been paid to the complicated problem of Chinese Semantic Error Diagnosis (CSED), which lacks relevant datasets. The study of semantic errors is important because they are very common and may lead to syntactic irregularities or even problems of comprehension. To investigate this, we build the CSED corpus, which includes two datasets. The one is for the CSED-Recognition (CSED-R) task. The other is for the CSED-Correction (CSED-C) task. Our annotation guarantees high-quality data through quality assurance mechanisms. Our experiments show that powerful pre-trained models perform poorly on this corpus. We also find that the CSED task is challenging, as evidenced by the fact that even humans receive a low score. This paper proposes syntax-aware models to specifically adapt to the CSED task. The experimental results show that the introduction of the syntax-aware approach is meaningful.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05183v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Dual Attention Network Based Reinforcement Learning","description":"Flexible manufacturing has given rise to complex scheduling problems such as the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In FJSP, operations can be processed on multiple machines, leading to intricate relationships between operations and machines. Recent works have employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving FJSP. However, the quality of solutions still has room for improvement relative to that by the exact methods such as OR-Tools. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel end-to-end learning framework that weds the merits of self-attention models for deep feature extraction and DRL for scalable decision-making. The complex relationships between operations and machines are represented precisely and concisely, for which a dual-attention network (DAN) comprising several interconnected operation message attention blocks and machine message attention blocks is proposed. The DAN exploits the complicated relationships to construct production-adaptive operation and machine features to support high-quality decisionmaking. Experimental results using synthetic data as well as public benchmarks corroborate that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional PDRs and the state-of-the-art DRL method. Moreover, it achieves results comparable to exact methods in certain cases and demonstrates favorable generalization ability to large-scale and real-world unseen FJSP tasks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05119v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Who Needs Decoders? Efficient Estimation of Sequence-level Attributes","description":"State-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models often require autoregressive decoding, which can be highly expensive. However, for some downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and resource allocation, the actual decoding output is not needed just a scalar attribute of this sequence. In these scenarios, where for example knowing the quality of a system's output to predict poor performance prevails over knowing the output itself, is it possible to bypass the autoregressive decoding? We propose Non-Autoregressive Proxy (NAP) models that can efficiently predict general scalar-valued sequence-level attributes. Importantly, NAPs predict these metrics directly from the encodings, avoiding the expensive autoregressive decoding stage. We consider two sequence-to-sequence task: Machine Translation (MT); and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In OOD for MT, NAPs outperform a deep ensemble while being significantly faster. NAPs are also shown to be able to predict performance metrics such as BERTScore (MT) or word error rate (ASR). For downstream tasks, such as data filtering and resource optimization, NAPs generate performance predictions that outperform predictive uncertainty while being highly inference efficient.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05098v1","created":"2023-05-09","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
