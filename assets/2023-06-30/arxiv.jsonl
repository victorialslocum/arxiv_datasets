{"title":"MEMD-ABSA: A Multi-Element Multi-Domain Dataset for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis","description":"Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a long-standing research interest in the field of opinion mining, and in recent years, researchers have gradually shifted their focus from simple ABSA subtasks to end-to-end multi-element ABSA tasks. However, the datasets currently used in the research are limited to individual elements of specific tasks, usually focusing on in-domain settings, ignoring implicit aspects and opinions, and with a small data scale. To address these issues, we propose a large-scale Multi-Element Multi-Domain dataset (MEMD) that covers the four elements across five domains, including nearly 20,000 review sentences and 30,000 quadruples annotated with explicit and implicit aspects and opinions for ABSA research. Meanwhile, we evaluate generative and non-generative baselines on multiple ABSA subtasks under the open domain setting, and the results show that open domain ABSA as well as mining implicit aspects and opinions remain ongoing challenges to be addressed. The datasets are publicly released at \\url{https://github.com/NUSTM/MEMD-ABSA}.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16956v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"BEDLAM: A Synthetic Dataset of Bodies Exhibiting Detailed Lifelike Animated Motion","description":"We show, for the first time, that neural networks trained only on synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the problem of 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation from real images. Previous synthetic datasets have been small, unrealistic, or lacked realistic clothing. Achieving sufficient realism is non-trivial and we show how to do this for full bodies in motion. Specifically, our BEDLAM dataset contains monocular RGB videos with ground-truth 3D bodies in SMPL-X format. It includes a diversity of body shapes, motions, skin tones, hair, and clothing. The clothing is realistically simulated on the moving bodies using commercial clothing physics simulation. We render varying numbers of people in realistic scenes with varied lighting and camera motions. We then train various HPS regressors using BEDLAM and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on real-image benchmarks despite training with synthetic data. We use BEDLAM to gain insights into what model design choices are important for accuracy. With good synthetic training data, we find that a basic method like HMR approaches the accuracy of the current SOTA method (CLIFF). BEDLAM is useful for a variety of tasks and all images, ground truth bodies, 3D clothing, support code, and more are available for research purposes. Additionally, we provide detailed information about our synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling others to generate their own datasets.

{"title":"MIS-FM: 3D Medical Image Segmentation using Foundation Models Pretrained on a Large-Scale Unannotated Dataset","description":"Pretraining with large-scale 3D volumes has a potential for improving the segmentation performance on a target medical image dataset where the training images and annotations are limited. Due to the high cost of acquiring pixel-level segmentation annotations on the large-scale pretraining dataset, pretraining with unannotated images is highly desirable. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning strategy named Volume Fusion (VF) for pretraining 3D segmentation models. It fuses several random patches from a foreground sub-volume to a background sub-volume based on a predefined set of discrete fusion coefficients, and forces the model to predict the fusion coefficient of each voxel, which is formulated as a self-supervised segmentation task without manual annotations. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture based on parallel convolution and transformer blocks that is suitable to be transferred to different downstream segmentation tasks with various scales of organs and lesions. The proposed model was pretrained with 110k unannotated 3D CT volumes, and experiments with different downstream segmentation targets including head and neck organs, thoracic/abdominal organs showed that our pretrained model largely outperformed training from scratch and several state-of-the-art self-supervised training methods and segmentation models.

{"title":"Surgical Phase and Instrument Recognition: How to identify appropriate Dataset Splits","description":"Purpose: The development of machine learning models for surgical workflow and instrument recognition from temporal data represents a challenging task due to the complex nature of surgical workflows. In particular, the imbalanced distribution of data is one of the major challenges in the domain of surgical workflow recognition. In order to obtain meaningful results, careful partitioning of data into training, validation, and test sets, as well as the selection of suitable evaluation metrics are crucial. Methods: In this work, we present an openly available web-based application that enables interactive exploration of dataset partitions. The proposed visual framework facilitates the assessment of dataset splits for surgical workflow recognition, especially with regard to identifying sub-optimal dataset splits. Currently, it supports visualization of surgical phase and instrument annotations. Results: In order to validate the dedicated interactive visualizations, we use a dataset split of the Cholec80 dataset. This dataset split was specifically selected to reflect a case of strong data imbalance. Using our software, we were able to identify phases, phase transitions, and combinations of surgical instruments that were not represented in one of the sets. Conclusion: In order to obtain meaningful results in highly unbalanced class distributions, special care should be taken with respect to the selection of an appropriate split.

MNISQ consists of 4,950,000 data points organized in 9 subdatasets. Building our dataset from the quantum encoding of classical information (e.g., MNIST dataset), we deliver a dataset in a dual form: in quantum form, as circuits, and in classical form, as quantum circuit descriptions (quantum programming language, QASM). In fact, also the Machine Learning research related to quantum computers undertakes a dual challenge: enhancing machine learning exploiting the power of quantum computers, while also leveraging state-of-the-art classical machine learning methodologies to help the advancement of quantum computing. Therefore, we perform circuit classification on our dataset, tackling the task with both quantum and classical models. In the quantum endeavor, we test our circuit dataset with Quantum Kernel methods, and we show excellent results up to $97\\%$ accuracy. In the classical world, the underlying quantum mechanical structures within the quantum circuit data are not trivial. Nevertheless, we test our dataset on three classical models: Structured State Space sequence model (S4), Transformer and LSTM. In particular, the S4 model applied on the tokenized QASM sequences reaches an impressive $77\\%$ accuracy. These findings illustrate that quantum circuit-related datasets are likely to be quantum advantageous, but also that state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies can competently classify and recognize quantum circuits. We finally entrust the quantum and classical machine learning community the fundamental challenge to build more quantum-classical datasets like ours and to build future benchmarks from our experiments.

{"title":"Towards Optimal Randomized Strategies in Adversarial Example Game","description":"The vulnerability of deep neural network models to adversarial example attacks is a practical challenge in many artificial intelligence applications. A recent line of work shows that the use of randomization in adversarial training is the key to find optimal strategies against adversarial example attacks. However, in a fully randomized setting where both the defender and the attacker can use randomized strategies, there are no efficient algorithm for finding such an optimal strategy. To fill the gap, we propose the first algorithm of its kind, called FRAT, which models the problem with a new infinite-dimensional continuous-time flow on probability distribution spaces. FRAT maintains a lightweight mixture of models for the defender, with flexibility to efficiently update mixing weights and model parameters at each iteration. Furthermore, FRAT utilizes lightweight sampling subroutines to construct a random strategy for the attacker. We prove that the continuous-time limit of FRAT converges to a mixed Nash equilibria in a zero-sum game formed by a defender and an attacker. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of FRAT on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16738v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

Quantum circuits need high-quality compilers to optimize the depth and gate count to boost the success probability on current noisy quantum computers. There is a rise of efficient but unreliable/untrusted compilers; however, they present a risk of tampering such as Trojan insertion. We propose TrojanNet, a novel approach to enhance the security of quantum circuits by detecting and classifying Trojan-inserted circuits. In particular, we focus on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuit that is popular in solving a wide range of optimization problems. We investigate the impact of Trojan insertion on QAOA circuits and develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, referred to as TrojanNet, to identify their presence accurately. Using the Qiskit framework, we generate 12 diverse datasets by introducing variations in Trojan gate types, the number of gates, insertion locations, and compiler backends. These datasets consist of both original Trojan-free QAOA circuits and their corresponding Trojan-inserted counterparts. The generated datasets are then utilized for training and evaluating the TrojanNet model. Experimental results showcase an average accuracy of 98.80% and an average F1-score of 98.53% in effectively detecting and classifying Trojan-inserted QAOA circuits. Finally, we conduct a performance comparison between TrojanNet and existing machine learning-based Trojan detection methods specifically designed for conventional netlists.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16701v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

This improves on previous work that requires that the gap between every pair of top-$k$ eigenvalues of $M$ is at least $\\sqrt{d}$ for a similar bound. Our analysis leverages the fact that the eigenvalues of complex matrix Brownian motion repel more than in the real case, and uses Dyson's stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of its eigenvalues to show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$ perturbed by complex Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. Our results contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under average-case perturbations and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for random matrices, which may be of independent interest.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16648v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Group-based Robustness: A General Framework for Customized Robustness in the Real World","description":"Machine-learning models are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks that perturb model inputs to induce misclassifications. In this work, we identify real-world scenarios where the true threat cannot be assessed accurately by existing attacks. Specifically, we find that conventional metrics measuring targeted and untargeted robustness do not appropriately reflect a model's ability to withstand attacks from one set of source classes to another set of target classes. To address the shortcomings of existing methods, we formally define a new metric, termed group-based robustness, that complements existing metrics and is better-suited for evaluating model performance in certain attack scenarios. We show empirically that group-based robustness allows us to distinguish between models' vulnerability against specific threat models in situations where traditional robustness metrics do not apply. Moreover, to measure group-based robustness efficiently and accurately, we 1) propose two loss functions and 2) identify three new attack strategies. We show empirically that with comparable success rates, finding evasive samples using our new loss functions saves computation by a factor as large as the number of targeted classes, and finding evasive samples using our new attack strategies saves time by up to 99\\% compared to brute-force search methods. Finally, we propose a defense method that increases group-based robustness by up to 3.52$\\times$.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16614v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Joint Level Generation and Translation Using Gameplay Videos","description":"Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) faces a significant hurdle that sets it apart from other fields, such as image or text generation, which is limited annotated data. Many existing methods for procedural level generation via machine learning require a secondary representation besides level images. However, the current methods for obtaining such representations are laborious and time-consuming, which contributes to this problem. In this work, we aim to address this problem by utilizing gameplay videos of two human-annotated games to develop a novel multi-tail framework that learns to perform simultaneous level translation and generation. The translation tail of our framework can convert gameplay video frames to an equivalent secondary representation, while its generation tail can produce novel level segments. Evaluation results and comparisons between our framework and baselines suggest that combining the level generation and translation tasks can lead to an overall improved performance regarding both tasks. This represents a possible solution to limited annotated level data, and we demonstrate the potential for future versions to generalize to unseen games.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16662v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"}}

We formed a new cost function in which modified L0-norm was used to represent the pupil-driven edge sparsity, and the qDPC convolution operator is duplicated in the data fidelity term to achieve automatic background removal.

{"title":"One-2-3-45: Any Single Image to 3D Mesh in 45 Seconds without Per-Shape Optimization","description":"Single image 3D reconstruction is an important but challenging task that requires extensive knowledge of our natural world. Many existing methods solve this problem by optimizing a neural radiance field under the guidance of 2D diffusion models but suffer from lengthy optimization time, 3D inconsistency results, and poor geometry. In this work, we propose a novel method that takes a single image of any object as input and generates a full 360-degree 3D textured mesh in a single feed-forward pass. Given a single image, we first use a view-conditioned 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to generate multi-view images for the input view, and then aim to lift them up to 3D space. Since traditional reconstruction methods struggle with inconsistent multi-view predictions, we build our 3D reconstruction module upon an SDF-based generalizable neural surface reconstruction method and propose several critical training strategies to enable the reconstruction of 360-degree meshes. Without costly optimizations, our method reconstructs 3D shapes in significantly less time than existing methods. Moreover, our method favors better geometry, generates more 3D consistent results, and adheres more closely to the input image. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic data and in-the-wild images and demonstrate its superiority in terms of both mesh quality and runtime. In addition, our approach can seamlessly support the text-to-3D task by integrating with off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16928v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"The Drunkard's Odometry: Estimating Camera Motion in Deforming Scenes","description":"Estimating camera motion in deformable scenes poses a complex and open research challenge. Most existing non-rigid structure from motion techniques assume to observe also static scene parts besides deforming scene parts in order to establish an anchoring reference. However, this assumption does not hold true in certain relevant application cases such as endoscopies. Deformable odometry and SLAM pipelines, which tackle the most challenging scenario of exploratory trajectories, suffer from a lack of robustness and proper quantitative evaluation methodologies. To tackle this issue with a common benchmark, we introduce the Drunkard's Dataset, a challenging collection of synthetic data targeting visual navigation and reconstruction in deformable environments. This dataset is the first large set of exploratory camera trajectories with ground truth inside 3D scenes where every surface exhibits non-rigid deformations over time. Simulations in realistic 3D buildings lets us obtain a vast amount of data and ground truth labels, including camera poses, RGB images and depth, optical flow and normal maps at high resolution and quality. We further present a novel deformable odometry method, dubbed the Drunkard's Odometry, which decomposes optical flow estimates into rigid-body camera motion and non-rigid scene deformations. In order to validate our data, our work contains an evaluation of several baselines as well as a novel tracking error metric which does not require ground truth data.

A real-time, computer-generated list of the most important, outlying data points from thousands of daily-updated public health data streams could assist an expert reviewer in identifying these irregularities. However, existing outlier detection frameworks perform poorly on this task because they do not account for the data volume or for the statistical properties of public health streams. Accordingly, we developed FlaSH (Flagging Streams in public Health), a practical outlier detection framework for public health data users that uses simple, scalable models to capture these statistical properties explicitly. In an experiment where human experts evaluate FlaSH and existing methods (including deep learning approaches), FlaSH scales to the data volume of this task, matches or exceeds these other methods in mean accuracy, and identifies the outlier points that users empirically rate as more helpful. Based on these results, FlaSH has been deployed on data streams used by public health stakeholders.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16914v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"From Query Tools to Causal Architects: Harnessing Large Language Models for Advanced Causal Discovery from Data","description":"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional abilities for causal analysis between concepts in numerous societally impactful domains, including medicine, science, and law. Recent research on LLM performance in various causal discovery and inference tasks has given rise to a new ladder in the classical three-stage framework of causality. In this paper, we advance the current research of LLM-driven causal discovery by proposing a novel framework that combines knowledge-based LLM causal analysis with data-driven causal structure learning. To make LLM more than a query tool and to leverage its power in discovering natural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable LLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into statistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and practical baseline for causal structure learning.   We introduce a universal set of prompts designed to extract causal graphs from given variables and assess the influence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal structures from data. We demonstrate the significant enhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recovered causal structures from data, while also identifying critical challenges and issues, along with potential approaches to address them. As a pioneering study, this paper aims to emphasize the new frontier that LLMs are opening for classical causal discovery and inference, and to encourage the widespread adoption of LLM capabilities in data-driven causal analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16902v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"SaGess: Sampling Graph Denoising Diffusion Model for Scalable Graph Generation","description":"Over recent years, denoising diffusion generative models have come to be considered as state-of-the-art methods for synthetic data generation, especially in the case of generating images. These approaches have also proved successful in other applications such as tabular and graph data generation. However, due to computational complexity, to this date, the application of these techniques to graph data has been restricted to small graphs, such as those used in molecular modeling. In this paper, we propose SaGess, a discrete denoising diffusion approach, which is able to generate large real-world networks by augmenting a diffusion model (DiGress) with a generalized divide-and-conquer framework. The algorithm is capable of generating larger graphs by sampling a covering of subgraphs of the initial graph in order to train DiGress. SaGess then constructs a synthetic graph using the subgraphs that have been generated by DiGress. We evaluate the quality of the synthetic data sets against several competitor methods by comparing graph statistics between the original and synthetic samples, as well as evaluating the utility of the synthetic data set produced by using it to train a task-driven model, namely link prediction. In our experiments, SaGess, outperforms most of the one-shot state-of-the-art graph generating methods by a significant factor, both on the graph metrics and on the link prediction task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16827v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Benchmarking Large Language Model Capabilities for Conditional Generation","description":"Pre-trained large language models (PLMs) underlie most new developments in natural language processing. They have shifted the field from application-specific model pipelines to a single model that is adapted to a wide range of tasks. Autoregressive PLMs like GPT-3 or PaLM, alongside techniques like few-shot learning, have additionally shifted the output modality to generation instead of classification or regression. Despite their ubiquitous use, the generation quality of language models is rarely evaluated when these models are introduced. Additionally, it is unclear how existing generation tasks--while they can be used to compare systems at a high level--relate to the real world use cases for which people have been adopting them. In this work, we discuss how to adapt existing application-specific generation benchmarks to PLMs and provide an in-depth, empirical study of the limitations and capabilities of PLMs in natural language generation tasks along dimensions such as scale, architecture, input and output language. Our results show that PLMs differ in their applicability to different data regimes and their generalization to multiple languages and inform which PLMs to use for a given generation task setup. We share best practices to be taken into consideration when benchmarking generation capabilities during the development of upcoming PLMs.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16793v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Learning from Synthetic Human Group Activities","description":"The understanding of complex human interactions and group activities has garnered attention in human-centric computer vision. However, the advancement of the related tasks is hindered due to the difficulty of obtaining large-scale labeled real-world datasets. To mitigate the issue, we propose M3Act, a multi-view multi-group multi-person human atomic action and group activity data generator. Powered by the Unity engine, M3Act contains simulation-ready 3D scenes and human assets, configurable lighting and camera systems, highly parameterized modular group activities, and a large degree of domain randomization during the data generation process. Our data generator is capable of generating large-scale datasets of human activities with multiple viewpoints, modalities (RGB images, 2D poses, 3D motions), and high-quality annotations for individual persons and multi-person groups (2D bounding boxes, instance segmentation masks, individual actions and group activity categories). Using M3Act, we perform synthetic data pre-training for 2D skeleton-based group activity recognition and RGB-based multi-person pose tracking. The results indicate that learning from our synthetic datasets largely improves the model performances on real-world datasets, with the highest gain of 5.59% and 7.32% respectively in group and person recognition accuracy on CAD2, as well as an improvement of 6.63 in MOTP on HiEve. Pre-training with our synthetic data also leads to faster model convergence on downstream tasks (up to 6.8% faster). Moreover, M3Act opens new research problems for 3D group activity generation. We release M3Act3D, an 87.6-hour 3D motion dataset of human activities with larger group sizes and higher complexity of inter-person interactions than previous multi-person datasets. We define multiple metrics and propose a competitive baseline for the novel task.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16772v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"IoT Data Processing for Smart City and Semantic Web Applications","description":"The world has been experiencing rapid urbanization over the last few decades, putting a strain on existing city infrastructure such as waste management, water supply management, public transport and electricity consumption. We are also seeing increasing pollution levels in cities threatening the environment, natural resources and health conditions. However, we must realize that the real growth lies in urbanization as it provides many opportunities to individuals for better employment, healthcare and better education. However, it is imperative to limit the ill effects of rapid urbanization through integrated action plans to enable the development of growing cities. This gave rise to the concept of a smart city in which all available information associated with a city will be utilized systematically for better city management.   The proposed system architecture is divided in subsystems and is discussed in individual chapters. The first chapter introduces and gives overview to the reader of the complete system architecture. The second chapter discusses the data monitoring system and data lake system based on the oneM2M standards. DMS employs oneM2M as a middleware layer to achieve interoperability, and DLS uses a multi-tenant architecture with multiple logical databases, enabling efficient and reliable data management. The third chapter discusses energy monitoring and electric vehicle charging systems developed to illustrate the applicability of the oneM2M standards. The fourth chapter discusses the Data Exchange System based on the Indian Urban Data Exchange framework. DES uses IUDX standard data schema and open APIs to avoid data silos and enable secure data sharing. The fifth chapter discusses the 5D-IoT framework that provides uniform data quality assessment of sensor data with meaningful data descriptions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16728v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"End-to-End Learnable Multi-Scale Feature Compression for VCM","description":"The proliferation of deep learning-based machine vision applications has given rise to a new type of compression, so called video coding for machine (VCM). VCM differs from traditional video coding in that it is optimized for machine vision performance instead of human visual quality. In the feature compression track of MPEG-VCM, multi-scale features extracted from images are subject to compression. Recent feature compression works have demonstrated that the versatile video coding (VVC) standard-based approach can achieve a BD-rate reduction of up to 96% against MPEG-VCM feature anchor. However, it is still sub-optimal as VVC was not designed for extracted features but for natural images. Moreover, the high encoding complexity of VVC makes it difficult to design a lightweight encoder without sacrificing performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature compression method that enables both the end-to-end optimization on the extracted features and the design of lightweight encoders. The proposed model combines a learnable compressor with a multi-scale feature fusion network so that the redundancy in the multi-scale features is effectively removed. Instead of simply cascading the fusion network and the compression network, we integrate the fusion and encoding processes in an interleaved way. Our model first encodes a larger-scale feature to obtain a latent representation and then fuses the latent with a smaller-scale feature. This process is successively performed until the smallest-scale feature is fused and then the encoded latent at the final stage is entropy-coded for transmission. The results show that our model outperforms previous approaches by at least 52% BD-rate reduction and has $\\times5$ to $\\times27$ times less encoding time for object detection. It is noteworthy that our model can attain near-lossless task performance with only 0.002-0.003% of the uncompressed feature data size.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16670v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction with Unrolled Diffusion Models","description":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) produces excellent soft tissue contrast, albeit it is an inherently slow imaging modality. Promising deep learning methods have recently been proposed to reconstruct accelerated MRI scans. However, existing methods still suffer from various limitations regarding image fidelity, contextual sensitivity, and reliance on fully-sampled acquisitions for model training. To comprehensively address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised deep reconstruction model, named Self-Supervised Diffusion Reconstruction (SSDiffRecon). SSDiffRecon expresses a conditional diffusion process as an unrolled architecture that interleaves cross-attention transformers for reverse diffusion steps with data-consistency blocks for physics-driven processing. Unlike recent diffusion methods for MRI reconstruction, a self-supervision strategy is adopted to train SSDiffRecon using only undersampled k-space data. Comprehensive experiments on public brain MR datasets demonstrates the superiority of SSDiffRecon against state-of-the-art supervised, and self-supervised baselines in terms of reconstruction speed and quality. Implementation will be available at https://github.com/yilmazkorkmaz1/SSDiffRecon.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16654v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Evaluating ChatGPT's Decimal Skills and Feedback Generation in a Digital Learning Game","description":"While open-ended self-explanations have been shown to promote robust learning in multiple studies, they pose significant challenges to automated grading and feedback in technology-enhanced learning, due to the unconstrained nature of the students' input. Our work investigates whether recent advances in Large Language Models, and in particular ChatGPT, can address this issue. Using decimal exercises and student data from a prior study of the learning game Decimal Point, with more than 5,000 open-ended self-explanation responses, we investigate ChatGPT's capability in (1) solving the in-game exercises, (2) determining the correctness of students' answers, and (3) providing meaningful feedback to incorrect answers. Our results showed that ChatGPT can respond well to conceptual questions, but struggled with decimal place values and number line problems. In addition, it was able to accurately assess the correctness of 75% of the students' answers and generated generally high-quality feedback, similar to human instructors. We conclude with a discussion of ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses and suggest several venues for extending its use cases in digital teaching and learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16639v1","created":"2023-06-29","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
