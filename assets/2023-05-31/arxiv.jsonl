{"title":"A Stutter Seldom Comes Alone -- Cross-Corpus Stuttering Detection as a Multi-label Problem","description":"Most stuttering detection and classification research has viewed stuttering as a multi-class classification problem or a binary detection task for each dysfluency type; however, this does not match the nature of stuttering, in which one dysfluency seldom comes alone but rather co-occurs with others. This paper explores multi-language and cross-corpus end-to-end stuttering detection as a multi-label problem using a modified wav2vec 2.0 system with an attention-based classification head and multi-task learning. We evaluate the method using combinations of three datasets containing English and German stuttered speech, one containing speech modified by fluency shaping. The experimental results and an error analysis show that multi-label stuttering detection systems trained on cross-corpus and multi-language data achieve competitive results but performance on samples with multiple labels stays below over-all detection results.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19255v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

In contrast, we find that networks actually can learn useful features that can be reweighed for high test performance, suggesting that image privacy is not preserved. Unlearnable datasets are also believed to induce learning shortcuts through linear separability of added perturbations. We provide a counterexample, demonstrating that linear separability of perturbations is not a necessary condition. To emphasize why linearly separable perturbations should not be relied upon, we propose an orthogonal projection attack which allows learning from unlearnable datasets published in ICML 2021 and ICLR 2023.

{"title":"SWiPE: A Dataset for Document-Level Simplification of Wikipedia Pages","description":"Text simplification research has mostly focused on sentence-level simplification, even though many desirable edits - such as adding relevant background information or reordering content - may require document-level context. Prior work has also predominantly framed simplification as a single-step, input-to-output task, only implicitly modeling the fine-grained, span-level edits that elucidate the simplification process. To address both gaps, we introduce the SWiPE dataset, which reconstructs the document-level editing process from English Wikipedia (EW) articles to paired Simple Wikipedia (SEW) articles. In contrast to prior work, SWiPE leverages the entire revision history when pairing pages in order to better identify simplification edits. We work with Wikipedia editors to annotate 5,000 EW-SEW document pairs, labeling more than 40,000 edits with proposed 19 categories. To scale our efforts, we propose several models to automatically label edits, achieving an F-1 score of up to 70.6, indicating that this is a tractable but challenging NLU task. Finally, we categorize the edits produced by several simplification models and find that SWiPE-trained models generate more complex edits while reducing unwanted edits.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19204v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"DEPLAIN: A German Parallel Corpus with Intralingual Translations into Plain Language for Sentence and Document Simplification","description":"Text simplification is an intralingual translation task in which documents, or sentences of a complex source text are simplified for a target audience. The success of automatic text simplification systems is highly dependent on the quality of parallel data used for training and evaluation. To advance sentence simplification and document simplification in German, this paper presents DEplain, a new dataset of parallel, professionally written and manually aligned simplifications in plain German (\"plain DE\" or in German: \"Einfache Sprache\"). DEplain consists of a news domain (approx. 500 document pairs, approx. 13k sentence pairs) and a web-domain corpus (approx. 150 aligned documents, approx. 2k aligned sentence pairs). In addition, we are building a web harvester and experimenting with automatic alignment methods to facilitate the integration of non-aligned and to be published parallel documents. Using this approach, we are dynamically increasing the web domain corpus, so it is currently extended to approx. 750 document pairs and approx. 3.5k aligned sentence pairs. We show that using DEplain to train a transformer-based seq2seq text simplification model can achieve promising results. We make available the corpus, the adapted alignment methods for German, the web harvester and the trained models here: https://github.com/rstodden/DEPlain.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18939v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Large Car-following Data Based on Lyft level-5 Open Dataset: Following Autonomous Vehicles vs. Human-driven Vehicles","description":"Car-Following (CF), as a fundamental driving behaviour, has significant influences on the safety and efficiency of traffic flow. Investigating how human drivers react differently when following autonomous vs. human-driven vehicles (HV) is thus critical for mixed traffic flow. Research in this field can be expedited with trajectory datasets collected by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, trajectories collected by AVs are noisy and not readily applicable for studying CF behaviour. This paper extracts and enhances two categories of CF data, HV-following-AV (H-A) and HV-following-HV (H-H), from the open Lyft level-5 dataset. First, CF pairs are selected based on specific rules. Next, the quality of raw data is assessed by anomaly analysis. Then, the raw CF data is corrected and enhanced via motion planning, Kalman filtering, and wavelet denoising. As a result, 29k+ H-A and 42k+ H-H car-following segments are obtained, with a total driving distance of 150k+ km. A diversity assessment shows that the processed data cover complete CF regimes for calibrating CF models. This open and ready-to-use dataset provides the opportunity to investigate the CF behaviours of following AVs vs. HVs from real-world data. It can further facilitate studies on exploring the impact of AVs on mixed urban traffic.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18921v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Fighting Bias with Bias: Promoting Model Robustness by Amplifying Dataset Biases","description":"NLP models often rely on superficial cues known as dataset biases to achieve impressive performance, and can fail on examples where these biases do not hold. Recent work sought to develop robust, unbiased models by filtering biased examples from training sets. In this work, we argue that such filtering can obscure the true capabilities of models to overcome biases, which might never be removed in full from the dataset. We suggest that in order to drive the development of models robust to subtle biases, dataset biases should be amplified in the training set. We introduce an evaluation framework defined by a bias-amplified training set and an anti-biased test set, both automatically extracted from existing datasets. Experiments across three notions of bias, four datasets and two models show that our framework is substantially more challenging for models than the original data splits, and even more challenging than hand-crafted challenge sets. Our evaluation framework can use any existing dataset, even those considered obsolete, to test model robustness. We hope our work will guide the development of robust models that do not rely on superficial biases and correlations. To this end, we publicly release our code and data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18917v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"Fine-Grained is Too Coarse: A Novel Data-Centric Approach for Efficient Scene Graph Generation","description":"Learning to compose visual relationships from raw images in the form of scene graphs is a highly challenging task due to contextual dependencies, but it is essential in computer vision applications that depend on scene understanding. However, no current approaches in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aim at providing useful graphs for downstream tasks. Instead, the main focus has primarily been on the task of unbiasing the data distribution for predicting more fine-grained relations. That being said, all fine-grained relations are not equally relevant and at least a part of them are of no use for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce the task of Efficient SGG that prioritizes the generation of relevant relations, facilitating the use of Scene Graphs in downstream tasks such as Image Generation. To support further approaches in this task, we present a new dataset, VG150-curated, based on the annotations of the popular Visual Genome dataset. We show through a set of experiments that this dataset contains more high-quality and diverse annotations than the one usually adopted by approaches in SGG. Finally, we show the efficiency of this dataset in the task of Image Generation from Scene Graphs. Our approach can be easily replicated to improve the quality of other Scene Graph Generation datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18668v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

However, probabilistic computation presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we develop an efficient and interpretable probabilistic computation framework by truncating the probabilistic representation up to its first two moments, i.e., mean and covariance. We instantiate the framework by training a deterministic surrogate of a stochastic network that learns the complex probabilistic representation via combinations of simple activations, encapsulating the non-linearities coupling of the mean and covariance. We show that when the mean is supervised for optimizing the task objective, the unsupervised covariance spontaneously emerging from the non-linear coupling with the mean faithfully captures the uncertainty associated with model predictions. Our research highlights the inherent computability and simplicity of probabilistic computation, enabling its wider application in large-scale settings.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19265v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

Our evaluation shows that T800 is an efficient solution that increases device computational capacity by excluding unsolicited malicious traffic from the processing pipeline. Additionally, T800 is adaptable to different systems and provides a well-documented performance evaluation strategy for security ML-based mechanisms on ESP32-based IoT systems.

While generally presumed innocuous, recent studies have demonstrated that motion data actually has the potential to uniquely identify VR users. In this study, we go a step further, showing that a variety of private user information can be inferred just by analyzing motion data recorded by VR devices. We conducted a large-scale survey of VR users (N=1,006) with dozens of questions ranging from background and demographics to behavioral patterns and health information. We then collected VR motion samples of each user playing the game ``Beat Saber,'' and attempted to infer their survey responses using just their head and hand motion patterns. Using simple machine learning models, many of these attributes could accurately and consistently be inferred from VR motion data alone, highlighting the pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-user VR applications.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19198v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Majority Voting Approach to Ransomware Detection","description":"Crypto-ransomware remains a significant threat to governments and companies alike, with high-profile cyber security incidents regularly making headlines. Many different detection systems have been proposed as solutions to the ever-changing dynamic landscape of ransomware detection. In the majority of cases, these described systems propose a method based on the result of a single test performed on either the executable code, the process under investigation, its behaviour, or its output. In a small subset of ransomware detection systems, the concept of a scorecard is employed where multiple tests are performed on various aspects of a process under investigation and their results are then analysed using machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new majority voting approach to ransomware detection by developing a method that uses a cumulative score derived from discrete tests based on calculations using algorithmic rather than heuristic techniques. The paper describes 23 candidate tests, as well as 9 Windows API tests which are validated to determine both their accuracy and viability for use within a ransomware detection system. Using a cumulative score calculation approach to ransomware detection has several benefits, such as the immunity to the occasional inaccuracy of individual tests when making its final classification. The system can also leverage multiple tests that can be both comprehensive and complimentary in an attempt to achieve a broader, deeper, and more robust analysis of the program under investigation. Additionally, the use of multiple collaborative tests also significantly hinders ransomware from masking or modifying its behaviour in an attempt to bypass detection.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18852v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Phase Correction using Deep Learning for Satellite-to-Ground CV-QKD","description":"Coherent measurement of quantum signals used for continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) across satellite-to-ground channels requires compensation of phase wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. One compensation technique involves multiplexing classical reference pulses (RPs) and the quantum signal, with direct phase measurements on the RPs then used to modulate a real local oscillator (RLO) on the ground - a solution that also removes some known attacks on CV-QKD. However, this is a cumbersome task in practice - requiring substantial complexity in equipment requirements and deployment. As an alternative to this traditional practice, here we introduce a new method for estimating phase corrections for an RLO by using only intensity measurements from RPs as input to a convolutional neural network, mitigating completely the necessity to measure phase wavefronts directly. Conventional wisdom dictates such an approach would likely be fruitless. However, we show that the phase correction accuracy needed to provide for non-zero secure key rates through satellite-to-ground channels is achieved by our intensity-only measurements. Our work shows, for the first time, how artificial intelligence algorithms can replace phase-measuring equipment in the context of CV-QKD delivered from space, thereby delivering an alternate deployment paradigm for this global quantum-communication application.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18737v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Encouraging Divergent Thinking in Large Language Models through Multi-Agent Debate","description":"Modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown remarkable performance on general language tasks but still struggle on complex reasoning tasks, which drives the research on cognitive behaviors of LLMs to explore human-like problem-solving strategies. Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of \"tit for tat\" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation. Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate and the modest level of \"tit for tat\" state are required for MAD to obtain good performance.

Insights From Large Language Models","description":"Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have the potential to shed light on the debate regarding the extent to which knowledge representation requires the grounding of embodied experience. Despite learning from limited modalities (e.g., text for GPT-3.5, and text+image for GPT-4), LLMs have nevertheless demonstrated human-like behaviors in various psychology tasks, which may provide an alternative interpretation of the acquisition of conceptual knowledge. We compared lexical conceptual representations between humans and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on subjective ratings of various lexical conceptual features or dimensions (e.g., emotional arousal, concreteness, haptic, etc.). The results show that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were strongly correlated with humans in some abstract dimensions, such as emotion and salience. In dimensions related to sensory and motor domains, GPT-3.5 shows weaker correlations while GPT-4 has made significant progress compared to GPT-3.5. Still, GPT-4 struggles to fully capture motor aspects of conceptual knowledge such as actions with foot/leg, mouth/throat, and torso. Moreover, we found that GPT-4's progress can largely be associated with its training in the visual domain. Certain aspects of conceptual representation appear to exhibit a degree of independence from sensory capacities, but others seem to necessitate them. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of knowledge representation from diverse perspectives and highlights the potential influence of embodied experience in shaping language and cognition.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19103v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

In particular, we check their ability to Understand the problem at hand; Apply appropriate algorithms or methods for its solution; and Generate a coherent response and a correct answer. We use 30 questions that are clear, without any ambiguities, fully described with plain text only, and have a unique, well defined correct answer. The questions are divided into two sets of 15 each. The questions of Set A are 15 \"Original\" problems that cannot be found online, while Set B contains 15 \"Published\" problems that one can find online, usually with their solution. Each question is posed three times to each chatbot. The answers are recorded and discussed, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It has been found that for straightforward arithmetic, algebraic expressions, or basic logic puzzles, chatbots may provide accurate solutions, although not in every attempt. However, for more complex mathematical problems or advanced logic tasks, their answers, although written in a usually \"convincing\" way, may not be reliable. Consistency is also an issue, as many times a chatbot will provide conflicting answers when given the same question more than once. A comparative quantitative evaluation of the three chatbots is made through scoring their final answers based on correctness. It was found that ChatGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in both sets of questions. Bard comes third in the original questions of Set A, behind the other two chatbots, while it has the best performance (first place) in the published questions of Set B. This is probably because Bard has direct access to the internet, in contrast to ChatGPT chatbots which do not have any communication with the outside world.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18618v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}
{"title":"AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation","description":"We propose a novel framework for learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks, such as making a smiley face using building blocks. These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further propose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively generates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective learning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and finetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial perception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the superiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a significant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4 based robot tasks.

{"title":"Event-Centric Query Expansion in Web Search","description":"In search engines, query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique to improve search experience. Previous studies often rely on long-term search log mining, which leads to slow updates and is sub-optimal for time-sensitive news searches. In this work, we present Event-Centric Query Expansion (EQE), a novel QE system that addresses these issues by mining the best expansion from a significant amount of potential events rapidly and accurately. This system consists of four stages, i.e., event collection, event reformulation, semantic retrieval and online ranking. Specifically, we first collect and filter news headlines from websites. Then we propose a generation model that incorporates contrastive learning and prompt-tuning techniques to reformulate these headlines to concise candidates. Additionally, we fine-tune a dual-tower semantic model to function as an encoder for event retrieval and explore a two-stage contrastive training approach to enhance the accuracy of event retrieval. Finally, we rank the retrieved events and select the optimal one as QE, which is then used to improve the retrieval of event-related documents.

{"title":"ConES: Concept Embedding Search for Parameter Efficient Tuning Large Vision Language Models","description":"Large pre-trained vision-language models have shown great prominence in transferring pre-acquired knowledge to various domains and downstream tasks with appropriate prompting or tuning. Existing prevalent tuning methods can be generally categorized into three genres: 1) prompt engineering by creating suitable prompt texts, which is time-consuming and requires domain expertise; 2) or simply fine-tuning the whole model, which is extremely inefficient; 3) prompt tuning through parameterized prompt embeddings with the text encoder. Nevertheless, all methods rely on the text encoder for bridging the modality gap between vision and language. In this work, we question the necessity of the cumbersome text encoder for a more lightweight and efficient tuning paradigm as well as more representative prompt embeddings closer to the image representations. To achieve this, we propose a Concept Embedding Search (ConES) approach by optimizing prompt embeddings -- without the need of the text encoder -- to capture the 'concept' of the image modality through a variety of task objectives. By dropping the text encoder, we are able to significantly speed up the learning process, \\eg, from about an hour to just ten minutes in our experiments for personalized text-to-image generation without impairing the generation quality. Moreover, our proposed approach is orthogonal to current existing tuning methods since the searched concept embeddings can be further utilized in the next stage of fine-tuning the pre-trained large models for boosting performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach can beat the prompt tuning and textual inversion methods in a variety of downstream tasks including objection detection, instance segmentation, and image generation. Our approach also shows better generalization capability for unseen concepts in specialized domains, such as the medical domain.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18993v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}
{"title":"GPT4Tools: Teaching Large Language Model to Use Tools via Self-instruction","description":"This paper aims to efficiently enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to use multimodal tools. Advanced proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential for tool usage through sophisticated prompt engineering. Nevertheless, these models typically rely on prohibitive computational costs and publicly inaccessible data. To address these challenges, we propose the GPT4Tools based on self-instruct to enable open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and OPT, to use tools. It generates an instruction-following dataset by prompting an advanced teacher with various multi-modal contexts. By using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimization, our approach facilitates the open-source LLMs to solve a range of visual problems, including visual comprehension and image generation. Moreover, we provide a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to use tools, which is performed in both zero-shot and fine-tuning ways. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various language models, which not only significantly improves the accuracy of invoking seen tools, but also enables the zero-shot capacity for unseen tools.

{"title":"Make-A-Voice: Unified Voice Synthesis With Discrete Representation","description":"Various applications of voice synthesis have been developed independently despite the fact that they generate \"voice\" as output in common. In addition, the majority of voice synthesis models currently rely on annotated audio data, but it is crucial to scale them to self-supervised datasets in order to effectively capture the wide range of acoustic variations present in human voice, including speaker identity, emotion, and prosody. In this work, we propose Make-A-Voice, a unified framework for synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from discrete representations. Make-A-Voice leverages a \"coarse-to-fine\" approach to model the human voice, which involves three stages: 1) semantic stage: model high-level transformation between linguistic content and self-supervised semantic tokens, 2) acoustic stage: introduce varying control signals as acoustic conditions for semantic-to-acoustic modeling, and 3) generation stage: synthesize high-fidelity waveforms from acoustic tokens. Make-A-Voice offers notable benefits as a unified voice synthesis framework: 1) Data scalability: the major backbone (i.e., acoustic and generation stage) does not require any annotations, and thus the training data could be scaled up. 2) Controllability and conditioning flexibility: we investigate different conditioning mechanisms and effectively handle three voice synthesis applications, including text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and singing voice synthesis (SVS) by re-synthesizing the discrete voice representations with prompt guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Voice exhibits superior audio quality and style similarity compared with competitive baseline models.

{"title":"Unsupervised Melody-to-Lyric Generation","description":"Automatic melody-to-lyric generation is a task in which song lyrics are generated to go with a given melody. It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics. The training data is limited as most songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned melody-lyric data. Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics. The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from inference (melody-guided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of parallel data.   We leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during inference. The two-step hierarchical design also enables content control via the lyric outline, a much-desired feature for democratizing collaborative song creation. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality lyrics that are more on-topic, singable, intelligible, and coherent than strong baselines, for example SongMASS, a SOTA model trained on a parallel dataset, with a 24% relative overall quality improvement based on human ratings.

{"title":"Compression with Bayesian Implicit Neural Representations","description":"Many common types of data can be represented as functions that map coordinates to signal values, such as pixel locations to RGB values in the case of an image. Based on this view, data can be compressed by overfitting a compact neural network to its functional representation and then encoding the network weights. However, most current solutions for this are inefficient, as quantization to low-bit precision substantially degrades the reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we propose overfitting variational Bayesian neural networks to the data and compressing an approximate posterior weight sample using relative entropy coding instead of quantizing and entropy coding it. This strategy enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance by minimizing the $\\beta$-ELBO, and target different rate-distortion trade-offs for a given network architecture by adjusting $\\beta$. Moreover, we introduce an iterative algorithm for learning prior weight distributions and employ a progressive refinement process for the variational posterior that significantly enhances performance. Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on image and audio compression while retaining simplicity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19185v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Despite the excellent demonstrations of high-performance unipolar devices, the lack of p-type doping in $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has hindered the development of Ga$_2$O$_3$-based bipolar devices. The approach of p-n diodes formed by polycrystalline p-type oxides with n-type $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can face severe challenges in further advancing the $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ bipolar devices due to their unfavorable band alignment and the poor p-type oxide crystal quality. In this work, we applied the semiconductor grafting approach to fabricate monocrystalline Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diodes for the first time. With enhanced concentration of oxygen atoms at the interface of Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, double side surface passivation was achieved for both Si and $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with an interface Dit value of 1-3 x 1012 /cm2 eV. A Si/$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diode array with high fabrication yield was demonstrated along with a diode rectification of 1.3 x 107 at +/- 2 V, a diode ideality factor of 1.13 and avalanche reverse breakdown characteristics.

{"title":"DisCLIP: Open-Vocabulary Referring Expression Generation","description":"Referring Expressions Generation (REG) aims to produce textual descriptions that unambiguously identifies specific objects within a visual scene. Traditionally, this has been achieved through supervised learning methods, which perform well on specific data distributions but often struggle to generalize to new images and concepts. To address this issue, we present a novel approach for REG, named DisCLIP, short for discriminative CLIP. We build on CLIP, a large-scale visual-semantic model, to guide an LLM to generate a contextual description of a target concept in an image while avoiding other distracting concepts. Notably, this optimization happens at inference time and does not require additional training or tuning of learned parameters. We measure the quality of the generated text by evaluating the capability of a receiver model to accurately identify the described object within the scene. To achieve this, we use a frozen zero-shot comprehension module as a critique of our generated referring expressions. We evaluate DisCLIP on multiple referring expression benchmarks through human evaluation and show that it significantly outperforms previous methods on out-of-domain datasets. Our results highlight the potential of using pre-trained visual-semantic models for generating high-quality contextual descriptions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19108v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"NicePIM: Design Space Exploration for Processing-In-Memory DNN Accelerators with 3D-Stacked-DRAM","description":"With the widespread use of deep neural networks(DNNs) in intelligent systems, DNN accelerators with high performance and energy efficiency are greatly demanded. As one of the feasible processing-in-memory(PIM) architectures, 3D-stacked-DRAM-based PIM(DRAM-PIM) architecture enables large-capacity memory and low-cost memory access, which is a promising solution for DNN accelerators with better performance and energy efficiency. However, the low-cost characteristics of stacked DRAM and the distributed manner of memory access and data storing require us to rebalance the hardware design and DNN mapping. In this paper, we propose NicePIM to efficiently explore the design space of hardware architecture and DNN mapping of DRAM-PIM accelerators, which consists of three key components: PIM-Tuner, PIM-Mapper and Data-Scheduler. PIM-Tuner optimizes the hardware configurations leveraging a DNN model for classifying area-compliant architectures and a deep kernel learning model for identifying better hardware parameters. PIM-Mapper explores a variety of DNN mapping configurations, including parallelism between branches of DNN, DNN layer partitioning, DRAM capacity allocation and data layout pattern in DRAM to generate high-hardware-utilization DNN mapping schemes for various hardware configurations. The Data-Scheduler employs an integer-linear-programming-based data scheduling algorithm to alleviate the inter-PIM-node communication overhead of data-sharing brought by DNN layer partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that NicePIM can optimize hardware configurations for DRAM-PIM systems effectively and can generate high-quality DNN mapping schemes with latency and energy cost reduced by 37% and 28% on average respectively compared to the baseline method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19041v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Nevertheless, the limited availability of diverse 3D resources presents significant challenges to learning. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating high-quality, stylized 3D avatars that utilizes pre-trained image-text diffusion models for data generation and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based 3D generation network for training. Our method leverages the comprehensive priors of appearance and geometry offered by image-text diffusion models to generate multi-view images of avatars in various styles. During data generation, we employ poses extracted from existing 3D models to guide the generation of multi-view images. To address the misalignment between poses and images in data, we investigate view-specific prompts and develop a coarse-to-fine discriminator for GAN training. We also delve into attribute-related prompts to increase the diversity of the generated avatars. Additionally, we develop a latent diffusion model within the style space of StyleGAN to enable the generation of avatars based on image inputs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and diversity of the produced avatars.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19012v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"A Recipe for Efficient SBIR Models: Combining Relative Triplet Loss with Batch Normalization and Knowledge Distillation","description":"Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve a set of images that match a given sketch query. Researchers have already proposed several well-performing solutions for this task, but most focus on enhancing embedding through different approaches such as triplet loss, quadruplet loss, adding data augmentation, and using edge extraction. In this work, we tackle the problem from various angles. We start by examining the training data quality and show some of its limitations. Then, we introduce a Relative Triplet Loss (RTL), an adapted triplet loss to overcome those limitations through loss weighting based on anchors similarity. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that replacing a triplet loss with RTL outperforms previous state-of-the-art without the need for any data augmentation. In addition, we demonstrate why batch normalization is more suited for SBIR embeddings than l2-normalization and show that it improves significantly the performance of our models. We further investigate the capacity of models required for the photo and sketch domains and demonstrate that the photo encoder requires a higher capacity than the sketch encoder, which validates the hypothesis formulated in [34]. Then, we propose a straightforward approach to train small models, such as ShuffleNetv2 [22] efficiently with a marginal loss of accuracy through knowledge distillation. The same approach used with larger models enabled us to outperform previous state-of-the-art results and achieve a recall of 62.38% at k = 1 on The Sketchy Database [30].","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18988v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

DEplain consists of a news domain (approx. 500 document pairs, approx. 13k sentence pairs) and a web-domain corpus (approx. 150 aligned documents, approx. 2k aligned sentence pairs). In addition, we are building a web harvester and experimenting with automatic alignment methods to facilitate the integration of non-aligned and to be published parallel documents. Using this approach, we are dynamically increasing the web domain corpus, so it is currently extended to approx. 750 document pairs and approx. 3.5k aligned sentence pairs.

{"title":"Large Car-following Data Based on Lyft level-5 Open Dataset: Following Autonomous Vehicles vs. Human-driven Vehicles","description":"Car-Following (CF), as a fundamental driving behaviour, has significant influences on the safety and efficiency of traffic flow. Investigating how human drivers react differently when following autonomous vs. human-driven vehicles (HV) is thus critical for mixed traffic flow. Research in this field can be expedited with trajectory datasets collected by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, trajectories collected by AVs are noisy and not readily applicable for studying CF behaviour. This paper extracts and enhances two categories of CF data, HV-following-AV (H-A) and HV-following-HV (H-H), from the open Lyft level-5 dataset. First, CF pairs are selected based on specific rules. Next, the quality of raw data is assessed by anomaly analysis. Then, the raw CF data is corrected and enhanced via motion planning, Kalman filtering, and wavelet denoising. As a result, 29k+ H-A and 42k+ H-H car-following segments are obtained, with a total driving distance of 150k+ km. A diversity assessment shows that the processed data cover complete CF regimes for calibrating CF models. This open and ready-to-use dataset provides the opportunity to investigate the CF behaviours of following AVs vs. HVs from real-world data. It can further facilitate studies on exploring the impact of AVs on mixed urban traffic.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18921v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"One-Line-of-Code Data Mollification Improves Optimization of Likelihood-based Generative Models","description":"Generative Models (GMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tremendous success in various domains, such as computer vision where they are capable to generate impressive realistic-looking images. Likelihood-based GMs are attractive due to the possibility to generate new data by a single model evaluation. However, they typically achieve lower sample quality compared to state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models (DMs). This paper provides a significant step in the direction of addressing this limitation. The idea is to borrow one of the strengths of score-based DMs, which is the ability to perform accurate density estimation in low-density regions and to address manifold overfitting by means of data mollification. We connect data mollification through the addition of Gaussian noise to Gaussian homotopy, which is a well-known technique to improve optimization. Data mollification can be implemented by adding one line of code in the optimization loop, and we demonstrate that this provides a boost in generation quality of likelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads. We report results on image data sets with popular likelihood-based GMs, including variants of variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, showing large improvements in FID score.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18900v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Contrastive Shapelet Learning for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning","description":"Recent studies have shown great promise in unsupervised representation learning (URL) for multivariate time series, because URL has the capability in learning generalizable representation for many downstream tasks without using inaccessible labels. However, existing approaches usually adopt the models originally designed for other domains (e.g., computer vision) to encode the time series data and rely on strong assumptions to design learning objectives, which limits their ability to perform well. To deal with these problems, we propose a novel URL framework for multivariate time series by learning time-series-specific shapelet-based representation through a popular contrasting learning paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the shapelet-based embedding in the unsupervised general-purpose representation learning. A unified shapelet-based encoder and a novel learning objective with multi-grained contrasting and multi-scale alignment are particularly designed to achieve our goal, and a data augmentation library is employed to improve the generalization. We conduct extensive experiments using tens of real-world datasets to assess the representation quality on many downstream tasks, including classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against not only URL competitors, but also techniques specially designed for downstream tasks.

{"title":"Generate then Select: Open-ended Visual Question Answering Guided by World Knowledge","description":"The open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires AI models to jointly reason over visual and natural language inputs using world knowledge. Recently, pre-trained Language Models (PLM) such as GPT-3 have been applied to the task and shown to be powerful world knowledge sources. However, these methods suffer from low knowledge coverage caused by PLM bias -- the tendency to generate certain tokens over other tokens regardless of prompt changes, and high dependency on the PLM quality -- only models using GPT-3 can achieve the best result.   To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose RASO: a new VQA pipeline that deploys a generate-then-select strategy guided by world knowledge for the first time. Rather than following the de facto standard to train a multi-modal model that directly generates the VQA answer, RASO first adopts PLM to generate all the possible answers, and then trains a lightweight answer selection model for the correct answer. As proved in our analysis, RASO expands the knowledge coverage from in-domain training data by a large margin. We provide extensive experimentation and show the effectiveness of our pipeline by advancing the state-of-the-art by 4.1% on OK-VQA, without additional computation cost.

Previous work has used perturbation-based saliency methods to tackle this issue, perturbing an input using a trainable mask to discover which features at which times are driving the predictions. However these methods introduce fixed perturbations, inspired from similar methods on static data, while there seems to be little motivation to do so on temporal data. In this work, we aim to explain predictions by learning not only masks, but also associated perturbations.

{"title":"Algorithmic Foundations of Inexact Computing","description":"Inexact computing also referred to as approximate computing is a style of designing algorithms and computing systems wherein the accuracy of correctness of algorithms executing on them is deliberately traded for significant resource savings. Significant progress has been reported in this regard both in terms of hardware as well as software or custom algorithms that exploited this approach resulting in some loss in solution quality (accuracy) while garnering disproportionately high savings. However, these approaches tended to be ad-hoc and were tied to specific algorithms and technologies. Consequently, a principled approach to designing and analyzing algorithms was lacking.   In this paper, we provide a novel model which allows us to characterize the behavior of algorithms designed to be inexact, as well as characterize opportunities and benefits that this approach offers. Our methods therefore are amenable to standard asymptotic analysis and provides a clean unified abstraction through which an algorithm's design and analysis can be conducted. With this as a backdrop, we show that inexactness can be significantly beneficial for some fundamental problems in that the quality of a solution can be exponentially better if one exploits inexactness when compared to approaches that are agnostic and are unable to exploit this approach. We show that such gains are possible in the context of evaluating Boolean functions rooted in the theory of Boolean functions and their spectra, PAC learning, and sorting. Formally, this is accomplished by introducing the twin concepts of inexactness aware and inexactness oblivious approaches to designing algorithms and the exponential gains are shown in the context of taking the ratio of the quality of the solution using the \"aware\" approach to the \"oblivious\" approach.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18705v1","created":"2023-05-30","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

However, no current approaches in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aim at providing useful graphs for downstream tasks. Instead, the main focus has primarily been on the task of unbiasing the data distribution for predicting more fine-grained relations. That being said, all fine-grained relations are not equally relevant and at least a part of them are of no use for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce the task of Efficient SGG that prioritizes the generation of relevant relations, facilitating the use of Scene Graphs in downstream tasks such as Image Generation. To support further approaches in this task, we present a new dataset, VG150-curated, based on the annotations of the popular Visual Genome dataset. We show through a set of experiments that this dataset contains more high-quality and diverse annotations than the one usually adopted by approaches in SGG. Finally, we show the efficiency of this dataset in the task of Image Generation from Scene Graphs.
