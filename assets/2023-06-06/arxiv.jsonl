{"title":"Benchmarking Large Language Models on CMExam -- A Comprehensive Chinese Medical Exam Dataset","description":"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of question answering (QA). However, evaluating LLMs in the medical field is challenging due to the lack of standardized and comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce CMExam, sourced from the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination. CMExam consists of 60K+ multiple-choice questions for standardized and objective evaluations, as well as solution explanations for model reasoning evaluation in an open-ended manner. For in-depth analyses of LLMs, we invited medical professionals to label five additional question-wise annotations, including disease groups, clinical departments, medical disciplines, areas of competency, and question difficulty levels. Alongside the dataset, we further conducted thorough experiments with representative LLMs and QA algorithms on CMExam. The results show that GPT-4 had the best accuracy of 61.5% and a weighted F1 score of 0.616. These results highlight a great disparity when compared to human accuracy, which stood at 71.6%. For explanation tasks, while LLMs could generate relevant reasoning and demonstrate improved performance after finetuning, they fall short of a desired standard, indicating ample room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, CMExam is the first Chinese medical exam dataset to provide comprehensive medical annotations. The experiments and findings of LLM evaluation also provide valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions in developing Chinese medical QA systems and LLM evaluation pipelines.

{"title":"Weakly-Supervised Conditional Embedding for Referred Visual Search","description":"This paper presents a new approach to image similarity search in the context of fashion, a domain with inherent ambiguity due to the multiple ways in which images can be considered similar. We introduce the concept of Referred Visual Search (RVS), where users provide additional information to define the desired similarity. We present a new dataset, LAION-RVS-Fashion, consisting of 272K fashion products with 842K images extracted from LAION, designed explicitly for this task. We then propose an innovative method for learning conditional embeddings using weakly-supervised training, achieving a 6% increase in Recall at one (R@1) against a gallery with 2M distractors, compared to classical approaches based on explicit attention and filtering. The proposed method demonstrates robustness, maintaining similar R@1 when dealing with 2.5 times as many distractors as the baseline methods. We believe this is a step forward in the emerging field of Referred Visual Search both in terms of accessible data and approach.

{"title":"Single-Stage 3D Geometry-Preserving Depth Estimation Model Training on Dataset Mixtures with Uncalibrated Stereo Data","description":"Nowadays, robotics, AR, and 3D modeling applications attract considerable attention to single-view depth estimation (SVDE) as it allows estimating scene geometry from a single RGB image. Recent works have demonstrated that the accuracy of an SVDE method hugely depends on the diversity and volume of the training data. However, RGB-D datasets obtained via depth capturing or 3D reconstruction are typically small, synthetic datasets are not photorealistic enough, and all these datasets lack diversity. The large-scale and diverse data can be sourced from stereo images or stereo videos from the web. Typically being uncalibrated, stereo data provides disparities up to unknown shift (geometrically incomplete data), so stereo-trained SVDE methods cannot recover 3D geometry. It was recently shown that the distorted point clouds obtained with a stereo-trained SVDE method can be corrected with additional point cloud modules (PCM) separately trained on the geometrically complete data. On the contrary, we propose GP$^{2}$, General-Purpose and Geometry-Preserving training scheme, and show that conventional SVDE models can learn correct shifts themselves without any post-processing, benefiting from using stereo data even in the geometry-preserving setting. Through experiments on different dataset mixtures, we prove that GP$^{2}$-trained models outperform methods relying on PCM in both accuracy and speed, and report the state-of-the-art results in the general-purpose geometry-preserving SVDE. Moreover, we show that SVDE models can learn to predict geometrically correct depth even when geometrically complete data comprises the minor part of the training set.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02878v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

Varying motivations across research fields lead to differences in the domain choices to study and in the conceptualization of deception, making it hard to compare models and build robust deception detection systems for a given language. With this paper, we improve this situation by surveying available English deception datasets which include domains like social media reviews, court testimonials, opinion statements on specific topics, and deceptive dialogues from online strategy games. We consolidate these datasets into a single unified corpus. Based on this resource, we conduct a correlation analysis of linguistic cues of deception across datasets to understand the differences and perform cross-corpus modeling experiments which show that a cross-domain generalization is challenging to achieve.

{"title":"Fast Search-By-Classification for Large-Scale Databases Using Index-Aware Decision Trees and Random Forests","description":"The vast amounts of data collected in various domains pose great challenges to modern data exploration and analysis. To find \"interesting\" objects in large databases, users typically define a query using positive and negative example objects and train a classification model to identify the objects of interest in the entire data catalog. However, this approach requires a scan of all the data to apply the classification model to each instance in the data catalog, making this method prohibitively expensive to be employed in large-scale databases serving many users and queries interactively. In this work, we propose a novel framework for such search-by-classification scenarios that allows users to interactively search for target objects by specifying queries through a small set of positive and negative examples. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can rapidly answer such queries at low cost without scanning the entire database. Our framework is based on an index-aware construction scheme for decision trees and random forests that transforms the inference phase of these classification models into a set of range queries, which in turn can be efficiently executed by leveraging multidimensional indexing structures. Our experiments show that queries over large data catalogs with hundreds of millions of objects can be processed in a few seconds using a single server, compared to hours needed by classical scanning-based approaches.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02670v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Colexifications for Bootstrapping Cross-lingual Datasets: The Case of Phonology, Concreteness, and Affectiveness","description":"Colexification refers to the linguistic phenomenon where a single lexical form is used to convey multiple meanings. By studying cross-lingual colexifications, researchers have gained valuable insights into fields such as psycholinguistics and cognitive sciences [Jackson et al.,2019]. While several multilingual colexification datasets exist, there is untapped potential in using this information to bootstrap datasets across such semantic features. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate how colexifications can be leveraged to create such cross-lingual datasets. We showcase curation procedures which result in a dataset covering 142 languages across 21 language families across the world. The dataset includes ratings of concreteness and affectiveness, mapped with phonemes and phonological features. We further analyze the dataset along different dimensions to demonstrate potential of the proposed procedures in facilitating further interdisciplinary research in psychology, cognitive science, and multilingual natural language processing (NLP). Based on initial investigations, we observe that i) colexifications that are closer in concreteness/affectiveness are more likely to colexify; ii) certain initial/last phonemes are significantly correlated with concreteness/affectiveness intra language families, such as /k/ as the initial phoneme in both Turkic and Tai-Kadai correlated with concreteness, and /p/ in Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan correlated with Valence; iii) the type-to-token ratio (TTR) of phonemes are positively correlated with concreteness across several language families, while the length of phoneme segments are negatively correlated with concreteness; iv) certain phonological features are negatively correlated with concreteness across languages.

However, no existing study has ever investigated the pre-training of text plus graph models on large heterogeneous graphs with abundant textual information (a.k.a. large graph corpora) and then fine-tuning the model on different related downstream applications with different graph schemas. To address this problem, we propose a framework of graph-aware language model pre-training (GALM) on a large graph corpus, which incorporates large language models and graph neural networks, and a variety of fine-tuning methods on downstream applications.

{"title":"Discriminative Adversarial Privacy: Balancing Accuracy and Membership Privacy in Neural Networks","description":"The remarkable proliferation of deep learning across various industries has underscored the importance of data privacy and security in AI pipelines. As the evolution of sophisticated Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) threatens the secrecy of individual-specific information used for training deep learning models, Differential Privacy (DP) raises as one of the most utilized techniques to protect models against malicious attacks. However, despite its proven theoretical properties, DP can significantly hamper model performance and increase training time, turning its use impractical in real-world scenarios. Tackling this issue, we present Discriminative Adversarial Privacy (DAP), a novel learning technique designed to address the limitations of DP by achieving a balance between model performance, speed, and privacy. DAP relies on adversarial training based on a novel loss function able to minimise the prediction error while maximising the MIA's error. In addition, we introduce a novel metric named Accuracy Over Privacy (AOP) to capture the performance-privacy trade-off. Finally, to validate our claims, we compare DAP with diverse DP scenarios, providing an analysis of the results from performance, time, and privacy preservation perspectives.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03054v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Hiding in Plain Sight: Disguising Data Stealing Attacks in Federated Learning","description":"Malicious server (MS) attacks have enabled the scaling of data stealing in federated learning to large batch sizes and secure aggregation, settings previously considered private. However, many concerns regarding client-side detectability of MS attacks were raised, questioning their practicality once they are publicly known. In this work, for the first time, we thoroughly study the problem of client-side detectability.We demonstrate that most prior MS attacks, which fundamentally rely on one of two key principles, are detectable by principled client-side checks. Further, we formulate desiderata for practical MS attacks and propose SEER, a novel attack framework that satisfies all desiderata, while stealing user data from gradients of realistic networks, even for large batch sizes (up to 512 in our experiments) and under secure aggregation. The key insight of SEER is the use of a secret decoder, which is jointly trained with the shared model. Our work represents a promising first step towards more principled treatment of MS attacks, paving the way for realistic data stealing that can compromise user privacy in real-world deployments.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03013v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Satellite systems","description":"Federated learning in satellites offers several advantages. Firstly, it ensures data privacy and security, as sensitive data remains on the satellites and is not transmitted to a central location. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive or classified information. Secondly, federated learning allows satellites to collectively learn from a diverse set of data sources, benefiting from the distributed knowledge across the satellite network. Lastly, the use of federated learning reduces the communication bandwidth requirements between satellites and the central server, as only model updates are exchanged instead of raw data. By leveraging federated learning, satellites can collaborate and continuously improve their machine learning models while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This enables the development of more intelligent and efficient satellite systems for various applications, such as Earth observation, weather forecasting, and space exploration.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02996v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Evading Black-box Classifiers Without Breaking Eggs","description":"Decision-based evasion attacks repeatedly query a black-box classifier to generate adversarial examples. Prior work measures the cost of such attacks by the total number of queries made to the classifier. We argue this metric is flawed. Most security-critical machine learning systems aim to weed out \"bad\" data (e.g., malware, harmful content, etc). Queries to such systems carry a fundamentally asymmetric cost: queries detected as \"bad\" come at a higher cost because they trigger additional security filters, e.g., usage throttling or account suspension. Yet, we find that existing decision-based attacks issue a large number of \"bad\" queries, which likely renders them ineffective against security-critical systems. We then design new attacks that reduce the number of bad queries by $1.5$-$7.3\\times$, but often at a significant increase in total (non-bad) queries. We thus pose it as an open problem to build black-box attacks that are more effective under realistic cost metrics.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02895v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

Specifically, we relate the $L^\\infty$ learnability of a RKHS to the spectrum decay of the associate kernel and both lower bounds and upper bounds of the sample complexity are established. In particular, for dot-product kernels on the sphere, we identify conditions when the $L^\\infty$ learning can be achieved with polynomial samples. Let $d$ denote the input dimension and assume the kernel spectrum roughly decays as $\\lambda_k\\sim k^{-1-\\beta}$ with $\\beta>0$. We prove that if $\\beta$ is independent of the input dimension $d$, then functions in the RKHS can be learned efficiently under the $L^\\infty$ norm, i.e., the sample complexity depends polynomially on $d$. In contrast, if $\\beta=1/\\mathrm{poly}(d)$, then the $L^\\infty$ learning requires exponentially many samples.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02833v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Federated Intrusion Detection System based on Deep Belief Networks","description":"The vast increase of IoT technologies and the ever-evolving attack vectors and threat actors have increased cyber-security risks dramatically. Novel attacks can compromise IoT devices to gain access to sensitive data or control them to deploy further malicious activities. The detection of novel attacks often relies upon AI solutions. A common approach to implementing AI-based IDS in distributed IoT systems is in a centralised manner. However, this approach may violate data privacy and secrecy. In addition, centralised data collection prohibits the scale-up of IDSs. Therefore, intrusion detection solutions in IoT ecosystems need to move towards a decentralised direction. FL has attracted significant interest in recent years due to its ability to perform collaborative learning while preserving data confidentiality and locality. Nevertheless, most FL-based IDS for IoT systems are designed under unrealistic data distribution conditions. To that end, we design an experiment representative of the real world and evaluate the performance of two FL IDS implementations, one based on DNNs and another on our previous work on DBNs. For our experiments, we rely on TON-IoT, a realistic IoT network traffic dataset, associating each IP address with a single FL client. Additionally, we explore pre-training and investigate various aggregation methods to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity. Lastly, we benchmark our approach against a centralised solution. The comparison shows that the heterogeneous nature of the data has a considerable negative impact on the model performance when trained in a distributed manner. However, in the case of a pre-trained initial global FL model, we demonstrate a performance improvement of over 20% (F1-score) when compared against a randomly initiated global model.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02715v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"A Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Approach for Kernel methods","description":"It is challenging to implement Kernel methods, if the data sources are distributed and cannot be joined at a trusted third party for privacy reasons. It is even more challenging, if the use case rules out privacy-preserving approaches that introduce noise. An example for such a use case is machine learning on clinical data. To realize exact privacy preserving computation of kernel methods, we propose FLAKE, a Federated Learning Approach for KErnel methods on horizontally distributed data. With FLAKE, the data sources mask their data so that a centralized instance can compute a Gram matrix without compromising privacy. The Gram matrix allows to calculate many kernel matrices, which can be used to train kernel-based machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines. We prove that FLAKE prevents an adversary from learning the input data or the number of input features under a semi-honest threat model. Experiments on clinical and synthetic data confirm that FLAKE is outperforming the accuracy and efficiency of comparable methods. The time needed to mask the data and to compute the Gram matrix is several orders of magnitude less than the time a Support Vector Machine needs to be trained. Thus, FLAKE can be applied to many use cases.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02677v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Evaluating robustness of support vector machines with the Lagrangian dual approach","description":"Adversarial examples bring a considerable security threat to support vector machines (SVMs), especially those used in safety-critical applications. Thus, robustness verification is an essential issue for SVMs, which can provide provable robustness against various kinds of adversary attacks. The evaluation results obtained through the robustness verification can provide a safe guarantee for the use of SVMs. The existing verification method does not often perform well in verifying SVMs with nonlinear kernels. To this end, we propose a method to improve the verification performance for SVMs with nonlinear kernels. We first formalize the adversarial robustness evaluation of SVMs as an optimization problem. Then a lower bound of the original problem is obtained by solving the Lagrangian dual problem of the original problem. Finally, the adversarial robustness of SVMs is evaluated concerning the lower bound. We evaluate the adversarial robustness of SVMs with linear and nonlinear kernels on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The experimental results show that the percentage of provable robustness obtained by our method on the test set is better than that of the state-of-the-art.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02639v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

The findings highlight the promising potential of LLMs across various performance criteria, including relevance, accuracy, and applicability, though gaps remain in areas such as completeness and clarity. The study underlines the importance of integrating human expertise with LLM technology and refining model development to address these limitations.

{"title":"Large-Scale Distributed Learning via Private On-Device Locality-Sensitive Hashing","description":"Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based frameworks have been used efficiently to select weight vectors in a dense hidden layer with high cosine similarity to an input, enabling dynamic pruning. While this type of scheme has been shown to improve computational training efficiency, existing algorithms require repeated randomized projection of the full layer weight, which is impractical for computational- and memory-constrained devices. In a distributed setting, deferring LSH analysis to a centralized host is (i) slow if the device cluster is large and (ii) requires access to input data which is forbidden in a federated context. Using a new family of hash functions, we develop one of the first private, personalized, and memory-efficient on-device LSH frameworks. Our framework enables privacy and personalization by allowing each device to generate hash tables, without the help of a central host, using device-specific hashing hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hash tables or hash length). Hash tables are generated with a compressed set of the full weights, and can be serially generated and discarded if the process is memory-intensive. This allows devices to avoid maintaining (i) the fully-sized model and (ii) large amounts of hash tables in local memory for LSH analysis. We prove several statistical and sensitivity properties of our hash functions, and experimentally demonstrate that our framework is competitive in training large-scale recommender networks compared to other LSH frameworks which assume unrestricted on-device capacity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02563v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

To address this assessment gap, we devise three novel text-based tasks for situational reasoning in the traffic domain: i) BDD-QA, which evaluates the ability of Language Models (LMs) to perform situational decision-making, ii) TV-QA, which assesses LMs' abilities to reason about complex event causality, and iii) HDT-QA, which evaluates the ability of models to solve human driving exams. We adopt four knowledge-enhanced methods that have shown generalization capability across language reasoning tasks in prior work, based on natural language inference, commonsense knowledge-graph self-supervision, multi-QA joint training, and dense retrieval of domain information. We associate each method with a relevant knowledge source, including knowledge graphs, relevant benchmarks, and driving manuals. In extensive experiments, we benchmark various knowledge-aware methods against the three datasets, under zero-shot evaluation; we provide in-depth analyses of model performance on data partitions and examine model predictions categorically, to yield useful insights on traffic understanding, given different background knowledge and reasoning strategies.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02520v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

We explore whether generative AI could become a cost-effective complement to expert feedback by serving as an automated teacher coach. In doing so, we propose three teacher coaching tasks for generative AI: (A) scoring transcript segments based on classroom observation instruments, (B) identifying highlights and missed opportunities for good instructional strategies, and (C) providing actionable suggestions for eliciting more student reasoning. We recruit expert math teachers to evaluate the zero-shot performance of ChatGPT on each of these tasks for elementary math classroom transcripts. Our results reveal that ChatGPT generates responses that are relevant to improving instruction, but they are often not novel or insightful.

{"title":"InstructZero: Efficient Instruction Optimization for Black-Box Large Language Models","description":"Large language models~(LLMs) are instruction followers, but it can be challenging to find the best instruction for different situations, especially for black-box LLMs on which backpropagation is forbidden. Instead of directly optimizing the discrete instruction, we optimize a low-dimensional soft prompt applied to an open-source LLM to generate the instruction for the black-box LLM. On each iteration of the proposed method, which we call InstructZero, a soft prompt is converted into an instruction using the open-source LLM, which is then submitted to the black-box LLM for zero-shot evaluation, and the performance is sent to Bayesian optimization to produce new soft prompts improving the zero-shot performance. We evaluate InstructZero on different combinations of open-source LLMs and APIs including Vicuna and ChatGPT. Our results show that InstructZero outperforms SOTA auto-instruction methods across a variety of downstream tasks.

We find that ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe, which can reason upon in battle scenarios to a great extent, even when new information is introduced.

A number of issues impact the quality of these models, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs; small scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous evaluation resulting in overestimating the small model's capability as they tend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs. To address these challenges, we develop Orca (We are working with our legal team to publicly release a diff of the model weights in accordance with LLaMA's release policy to be published at https://aka.ms/orca-lm), a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought processes; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and diverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses conventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B by more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard (BBH) and 42% on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity with ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance (4 pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic examinations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot settings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4.

{"title":"SelfEvolve: A Code Evolution Framework via Large Language Models","description":"Large language models (LLMs) have already revolutionized code generation, after being pretrained on publicly available code data. However, while various methods have been proposed to augment LLMs with retrieved knowledge and enhance the quality of code generation, the performance of these retrieval-based methods is limited by the strength of the retrievers used. In addition, while LLMs show great emergent ability, they still struggle to produce the correct code in one turn. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-step pipeline, called \\autoknow, that leverages LLMs as both knowledge providers and self-reflective programmers. Unlike retrieval-based methods, \\autoknow~obtains the knowledge from input prompts and generates intermediate code based on the generated knowledge. After that, \\autoknow~asks LLM to act as an expert programmer to perform debugging for the generated code. This is achieved by receiving the error message from the interpreter, without requiring special test cases for correctness verification. We evaluate \\autoknow~on three code generation datasets, including DS-1000 for data science code, HumanEval for software engineering code, and TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation. Our empirical experiments show that \\autoknow~outperforms strong baselines by a significant margin on all datasets. We also conduct exhaustive analytical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the two stages of \\autoknow, and find that both are superior to other prompting-based methods.

{"title":"Cheap-fake Detection with LLM using Prompt Engineering","description":"The misuse of real photographs with conflicting image captions in news items is an example of the out-of-context (OOC) misuse of media. In order to detect OOC media, individuals must determine the accuracy of the statement and evaluate whether the triplet (~\\textit{i.e.}, the image and two captions) relates to the same event. This paper presents a novel learnable approach for detecting OOC media in ICME'23 Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes. The proposed method is based on the COSMOS structure, which assesses the coherence between an image and captions, as well as between two captions. We enhance the baseline algorithm by incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM), GPT3.5, as a feature extractor. Specifically, we propose an innovative approach to feature extraction utilizing prompt engineering to develop a robust and reliable feature extractor with GPT3.5 model. The proposed method captures the correlation between two captions and effectively integrates this module into the COSMOS baseline model, which allows for a deeper understanding of the relationship between captions. By incorporating this module, we demonstrate the potential for significant improvements in cheap-fakes detection performance. The proposed methodology holds promising implications for various applications such as natural language processing, image captioning, and text-to-image synthesis.

{"title":"User-friendly Image Editing with Minimal Text Input: Leveraging Captioning and Injection Techniques","description":"Recent text-driven image editing in diffusion models has shown remarkable success. However, the existing methods assume that the user's description sufficiently grounds the contexts in the source image, such as objects, background, style, and their relations. This assumption is unsuitable for real-world applications because users have to manually engineer text prompts to find optimal descriptions for different images. From the users' standpoint, prompt engineering is a labor-intensive process, and users prefer to provide a target word for editing instead of a full sentence. To address this problem, we first demonstrate the importance of a detailed text description of the source image, by dividing prompts into three categories based on the level of semantic details. Then, we propose simple yet effective methods by combining prompt generation frameworks, thereby making the prompt engineering process more user-friendly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the importance of prompts in text-driven image editing and our method is comparable to ground-truth prompts.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02717v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}
{"title":"Integrated Sensing, Computation, and Communication for UAV-assisted Federated Edge Learning","description":"Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables privacy-preserving model training through periodic communication between edge devices and the server. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted edge devices are particularly advantageous for FEEL due to their flexibility and mobility in efficient data collection. In UAV-assisted FEEL, sensing, computation, and communication are coupled and compete for limited onboard resources, and UAV deployment also affects sensing and communication performance. Therefore, the joint design of UAV deployment and resource allocation is crucial to achieving the optimal training performance. In this paper, we address the problem of joint UAV deployment design and resource allocation for FEEL via a concrete case study of human motion recognition based on wireless sensing. We first analyze the impact of UAV deployment on the sensing quality and identify a threshold value for the sensing elevation angle that guarantees a satisfactory quality of data samples. Due to the non-ideal sensing channels, we consider the probabilistic sensing model, where the successful sensing probability of each UAV is determined by its position. Then, we derive the upper bound of the FEEL training loss as a function of the sensing probability. Theoretical results suggest that the convergence rate can be improved if UAVs have a uniform successful sensing probability. Based on this analysis, we formulate a training time minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) resources under a desirable optimality gap constraint. To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-convex problem, we apply the alternating optimization technique, and propose the bandwidth, batch size, and position optimization (BBPO) scheme to optimize these three decision variables alternately.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02990v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

{"title":"Simultaneous or Sequential Training? How Speech Representations Cooperate in a Multi-Task Self-Supervised Learning System","description":"Speech representation learning with self-supervised algorithms has resulted in notable performance boosts in many downstream tasks. Recent work combined self-supervised learning (SSL) and visually grounded speech (VGS) processing mechanisms for representation learning. The joint training with SSL and VGS mechanisms provides the opportunity to utilize both unlabeled speech and speech-related visual information based on data availability. This has shown to enhance the quality of learned representations, especially at encoding semantic- and lexical-level knowledge. In this work, we further study the joint optimization of wav2vec 2.0-based SSL and transformer-based VGS as a multi-task learning system. We explore a set of training scenarios to understand how speech representations are shared or transferred between the two tasks, and what is the optimal training strategy for cross-modal semantic retrieval and phoneme discrimination performance. As a result, we find that sequential training with wav2vec 2.0 first and VGS next provides higher performance on audio-visual retrieval compared to simultaneous optimization of both learning mechanisms. However, the parallel SSL-VGS training reduces the effects of catastrophic forgetting when switching between optimization criteria. Moreover, the results suggest that phonemic representations learned through the VGS mechanism may generalize better across datasets compared to those learned with SSL.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02972v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Despite their success, there has been limited research on how the underlying diffusion process and the final convergent prior can affect generative performance; this research has also been limited to continuous data types and a score-based diffusion framework. To fill this gap, we explore how different discrete diffusion kernels (which converge to different prior distributions) affect the performance of diffusion models for graphs. To this end, we developed a novel formulation of a family of discrete diffusion kernels which are easily adjustable to converge to different Bernoulli priors, and we study the effect of these different kernels on generative performance. We show that the quality of generated graphs is sensitive to the prior used, and that the optimal choice cannot be explained by obvious statistics or metrics, which challenges the intuitions which previous works have suggested.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02957v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

{"title":"INDigo: An INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Inverse Problems","description":"Recently it has been shown that using diffusion models for inverse problems can lead to remarkable results. However, these approaches require a closed-form expression of the degradation model and can not support complex degradations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method (INDigo) that combines invertible neural networks (INN) and diffusion models for general inverse problems. Specifically, we train the forward process of INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse as a reconstruction process. During the diffusion sampling process, we impose an additional data-consistency step that minimizes the distance between the intermediate result and the INN-optimized result at every iteration, where the INN-optimized image is composed of the coarse information given by the observed degraded image and the details generated by the diffusion process. With the help of INN, our algorithm effectively estimates the details lost in the degradation process and is no longer limited by the requirement of knowing the closed-form expression of the degradation model. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually. Moreover, our algorithm performs well on more complex degradation models and real-world low-quality images.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02949v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Continual Learning with Pretrained Backbones by Tuning in the Input Space","description":"The intrinsic difficulty in adapting deep learning models to non-stationary environments limits the applicability of neural networks to real-world tasks. This issue is critical in practical supervised learning settings, such as the ones in which a pre-trained model computes projections toward a latent space where different task predictors are sequentially learned over time. As a matter of fact, incrementally fine-tuning the whole model to better adapt to new tasks usually results in catastrophic forgetting, with decreasing performance over the past experiences and losing valuable knowledge from the pre-training stage. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to make the fine-tuning procedure more effective, by avoiding to update the pre-trained part of the network and learning not only the usual classification head, but also a set of newly-introduced learnable parameters that are responsible for transforming the input data. This process allows the network to effectively leverage the pre-training knowledge and find a good trade-off between plasticity and stability with modest computational efforts, thus especially suitable for on-the-edge settings. Our experiments on four image classification problems in a continual learning setting confirm the quality of the proposed approach when compared to several fine-tuning procedures and to popular continual learning methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02947v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Zero shot framework for satellite image restoration","description":"Satellite images are typically subject to multiple distortions. Different factors affect the quality of satellite images, including changes in atmosphere, surface reflectance, sun illumination, viewing geometries etc., limiting its application to downstream tasks. In supervised networks, the availability of paired datasets is a strong assumption. Consequently, many unsupervised algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. These methods synthetically generate a large dataset of degraded images using image formation models. A neural network is then trained with an adversarial loss to discriminate between images from distorted and clean domains. However, these methods yield suboptimal performance when tested on real images that do not necessarily conform to the generation mechanism. Also, they require a large amount of training data and are rendered unsuitable when only a few images are available. We propose a distortion disentanglement and knowledge distillation framework for satellite image restoration to address these important issues. Our algorithm requires only two images: the distorted satellite image to be restored and a reference image with similar semantics. Specifically, we first propose a mechanism to disentangle distortion. This enables us to generate images with varying degrees of distortion using the disentangled distortion and the reference image. We then propose the use of knowledge distillation to train a restoration network using the generated image pairs. As a final step, the distorted image is passed through the restoration network to get the final output. Ablation studies show that our proposed mechanism successfully disentangles distortion.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02921v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

However, accurately reconstructing images from partial scan data (i.e., incomplete k-space matrices) remains challenging due to lack of an effectively global receptive field in both spatial and k-space domains. To address this problem, we propose the following: (1) a novel convolutional operator called Faster Fourier Convolution (FasterFC) to replace the two consecutive convolution operations typically used in convolutional neural networks (e.g., U-Net, ResNet). Based on the spectral convolution theorem in Fourier theory, FasterFC employs alternating kernels of size 1 in 3D case) in different domains to extend the dual-domain receptive field to the global and achieves faster calculation speed than traditional Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). (2) A 2D accelerated MRI method, FasterFC-End-to-End-VarNet, which uses FasterFC to improve the sensitivity maps and reconstruction quality. (3) A multi-stage 3D accelerated MRI method called FasterFC-based Single-to-group Network (FAS-Net) that utilizes a single-to-group algorithm to guide k-space domain reconstruction, followed by FasterFC-based cascaded convolutional neural networks to expand the effective receptive field in the dual-domain. Experimental results on the fastMRI and Stanford MRI Data datasets demonstrate that FasterFC improves the quality of both 2D and 3D reconstruction. Moreover, FAS-Net, as a 3D high-resolution multi-coil (eight) accelerated MRI method, achieves superior reconstruction performance in both qualitative and quantitative results compared with state-of-the-art 2D and 3D methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02886v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

We aim to show that, a high-quality automatic sleep stage scoring based on a proper quantification of BPV extracting from the single airflow signal can be achieved.   Methods: Topological data analysis (TDA) is applied to characterize BPV from the intrinsically nonstationary airflow signal, where the extracted features are used to train an automatic sleep stage scoring model using the XGBoost learner. The noise and artifacts commonly present in the airflow signal are recycled to enhance the performance of the trained system. The state-of-the-art approach is implemented for a comparison.   Results: When applied to 30 whole night polysomnogram signals with standard annotations, the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation shows that the proposed features (overall accuracy 78.8\\%$\\pm$8.7\\% and Cohen's kappa 0.56$\\pm 0.15$) outperforms those considered in the state-of-the-art work (overall accuracy 75.0\\%$\\pm$9.6\\% and Cohen's kappa 0.50$\\pm 0.15$) when applied to automatically score wake, rapid eyeball movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM). The TDA features are shown to contain complementary information to the traditional features commonly used in the literature via examining the feature importance. The respiratory quality index is found to be essential in the trained system.   Conclusion: The proposed TDA-assisted automatic annotation system can accurately distinguish wake, REM and NREM from the airflow signal.   Significance: Since only one single airflow channel is needed and BPV is universal, the result suggests that the TDA-assisted signal processing has potential to be applied to other biomedical signals and homecare problems other than the sleep stage annotation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02857v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

For general images, Transformer backbones are getting integrated more frequently in well-known neural network structures for denoising tasks. In this work, a modified UNet structure using a Swin Transformer backbone is presented to remove typical artifacts in scanned documents. Multi-headed cross-attention skip connections are used to more selectively learn features in respective levels of abstraction. The performance of this approach is examined regarding compression errors, pixelation and random noise. An improvement in text extraction quality with a reduced error rate of up to 53.9% on the synthetic data is archived. The pretrained base-model can be easily adapted to new artifacts.

{"title":"On Tail Decay Rate Estimation of Loss Function Distributions","description":"The study of loss function distributions is critical to characterize a model's behaviour on a given machine learning problem. For example, while the quality of a model is commonly determined by the average loss assessed on a testing set, this quantity does not reflect the existence of the true mean of the loss distribution. Indeed, the finiteness of the statistical moments of the loss distribution is related to the thickness of its tails, which are generally unknown. Since typical cross-validation schemes determine a family of testing loss distributions conditioned on the training samples, the total loss distribution must be recovered by marginalizing over the space of training sets. As we show in this work, the finiteness of the sampling procedure negatively affects the reliability and efficiency of classical tail estimation methods from the Extreme Value Theory, such as the Peaks-Over-Threshold approach. In this work we tackle this issue by developing a novel general theory for estimating the tails of marginal distributions, when there exists a large variability between locations of the individual conditional distributions underlying the marginal. To this end, we demonstrate that under some regularity conditions, the shape parameter of the marginal distribution is the maximum tail shape parameter of the family of conditional distributions. We term this estimation approach as Cross Tail Estimation (CTE). We test cross-tail estimation in a series of experiments on simulated and real data, showing the improved robustness and quality of tail estimation as compared to classical approaches, and providing evidence for the relationship between overfitting and loss distribution tail thickness.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02807v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

Our idea is to implicitly encode topology structure information into the node attributes in the synthesized graph-free data, whose topology is reduced to an identity matrix. Specifically, SFGC contains two collaborative components: (1) a training trajectory meta-matching scheme for effectively synthesizing small-scale graph-free data; (2) a graph neural feature score metric for dynamically evaluating the quality of the condensed data. Through training trajectory meta-matching, SFGC aligns the long-term GNN learning behaviors between the large-scale graph and the condensed small-scale graph-free data, ensuring comprehensive and compact transfer of informative knowledge to the graph-free data. Afterward, the underlying condensed graph-free data would be dynamically evaluated with the graph neural feature score, which is a closed-form metric for ensuring the excellent expressiveness of the condensed graph-free data. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of SFGC across different condensation ratios.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02664v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Towards Anytime Classification in Early-Exit Architectures by Enforcing Conditional Monotonicity","description":"Modern predictive models are often deployed to environments in which computational budgets are dynamic. Anytime algorithms are well-suited to such environments as, at any point during computation, they can output a prediction whose quality is a function of computation time. Early-exit neural networks have garnered attention in the context of anytime computation due to their capability to provide intermediate predictions at various stages throughout the network. However, we demonstrate that current early-exit networks are not directly applicable to anytime settings, as the quality of predictions for individual data points is not guaranteed to improve with longer computation. To address this shortcoming, we propose an elegant post-hoc modification, based on the Product-of-Experts, that encourages an early-exit network to become gradually confident. This gives our deep models the property of conditional monotonicity in the prediction quality -- an essential stepping stone towards truly anytime predictive modeling using early-exit architectures. Our empirical results on standard image-classification tasks demonstrate that such behaviors can be achieved while preserving competitive accuracy on average.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02652v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Coupled Variational Autoencoder","description":"Variational auto-encoders are powerful probabilistic models in generative tasks but suffer from generating low-quality samples which are caused by the holes in the prior. We propose the Coupled Variational Auto-Encoder (C-VAE), which formulates the VAE problem as one of Optimal Transport (OT) between the prior and data distributions. The C-VAE allows greater flexibility in priors and natural resolution of the prior hole problem by enforcing coupling between the prior and the data distribution and enables flexible optimization through the primal, dual, and semi-dual formulations of entropic OT. Simulations on synthetic and real data show that the C-VAE outperforms alternatives including VAE, WAE, and InfoVAE in fidelity to the data, quality of the latent representation, and in quality of generated samples.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02565v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Addressing Budget Allocation and Revenue Allocation in Data Market Environments Using an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm","description":"High-quality machine learning models are dependent on access to high-quality training data. When the data are not already available, it is tedious and costly to obtain them. Data markets help with identifying valuable training data: model consumers pay to train a model, the market uses that budget to identify data and train the model (the budget allocation problem), and finally the market compensates data providers according to their data contribution (revenue allocation problem). For example, a bank could pay the data market to access data from other financial institutions to train a fraud detection model. Compensating data contributors requires understanding data's contribution to the model; recent efforts to solve this revenue allocation problem based on the Shapley value are inefficient to lead to practical data markets.   In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to solve budget allocation and revenue allocation problems simultaneously in linear time. The new algorithm employs an adaptive sampling process that selects data from those providers who are contributing the most to the model. Better data means that the algorithm accesses those providers more often, and more frequent accesses corresponds to higher compensation. Furthermore, the algorithm can be deployed in both centralized and federated scenarios, boosting its applicability. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm that show the budget is used efficiently and the properties of revenue allocation are similar to Shapley's. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation to show the performance of the algorithm in practical scenarios and when compared to other baselines. Overall, we believe that the new algorithm paves the way for the implementation of practical data markets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02543v1","created":"2023-06-05","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
