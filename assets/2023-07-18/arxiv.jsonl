{"title":"Multimodal Diffusion Segmentation Model for Object Segmentation from Manipulation Instructions","description":"In this study, we aim to develop a model that comprehends a natural language instruction (e.g., \"Go to the living room and get the nearest pillow to the radio art on the wall\") and generates a segmentation mask for the target everyday object. The task is challenging because it requires (1) the understanding of the referring expressions for multiple objects in the instruction, (2) the prediction of the target phrase of the sentence among the multiple phrases, and (3) the generation of pixel-wise segmentation masks rather than bounding boxes. Studies have been conducted on languagebased segmentation methods; however, they sometimes mask irrelevant regions for complex sentences. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Diffusion Segmentation Model (MDSM), which generates a mask in the first stage and refines it in the second stage. We introduce a crossmodal parallel feature extraction mechanism and extend diffusion probabilistic models to handle crossmodal features. To validate our model, we built a new dataset based on the well-known Matterport3D and REVERIE datasets. This dataset consists of instructions with complex referring expressions accompanied by real indoor environmental images that feature various target objects, in addition to pixel-wise segmentation masks. The performance of MDSM surpassed that of the baseline method by a large margin of +10.13 mean IoU.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08597v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Distributed bundle adjustment with block-based sparse matrix compression for super large scale datasets","description":"We propose a distributed bundle adjustment (DBA) method using the exact Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for super large-scale datasets. Most of the existing methods partition the global map to small ones and conduct bundle adjustment in the submaps. In order to fit the parallel framework, they use approximate solutions instead of the LM algorithm. However, those methods often give sub-optimal results. Different from them, we utilize the exact LM algorithm to conduct global bundle adjustment where the formation of the reduced camera system (RCS) is actually parallelized and executed in a distributed way. To store the large RCS, we compress it with a block-based sparse matrix compression format (BSMC), which fully exploits its block feature. The BSMC format also enables the distributed storage and updating of the global RCS. The proposed method is extensively evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art pipelines using both synthetic and real datasets. Preliminary results demonstrate the efficient memory usage and vast scalability of the proposed method compared with the baselines. For the first time, we conducted parallel bundle adjustment using LM algorithm on a real datasets with 1.18 million images and a synthetic dataset with 10 million images (about 500 times that of the state-of-the-art LM-based BA) on a distributed computing system.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08383v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"G-Scan: Graph Neural Networks for Line-Level Vulnerability Identification in Smart Contracts","description":"Due to the immutable and decentralized nature of Ethereum (ETH) platform, smart contracts are prone to security risks that can result in financial loss. While existing machine learning-based vulnerability detection algorithms achieve high accuracy at the contract level, they require developers to manually inspect source code to locate bugs. To this end, we present G-Scan, the first end-to-end fine-grained line-level vulnerability detection system evaluated on the first-of-its-kind real world dataset. G-Scan first converts smart contracts to code graphs in a dependency and hierarchy preserving manner. Next, we train a graph neural network to identify vulnerable nodes and assess security risks. Finally, the code graphs with node vulnerability predictions are mapped back to the smart contracts for line-level localization. We train and evaluate G-Scan on a collected real world smart contracts dataset with line-level annotations on reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most common and severe types of smart contract vulnerabilities. With the well-designed graph representation and high-quality dataset, G-Scan achieves 93.02% F1-score in contract-level vulnerability detection and 93.69% F1-score in line-level vulnerability localization. Additionally, the lightweight graph neural network enables G-Scan to localize vulnerabilities in 6.1k lines of code smart contract within 1.2 seconds.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08549v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

To name just a few examples, some apps offer possibilities for entertainment, others for online banking, and others offer support for two-factor authentication. Therefore, with smartphones also, sensitive information is shared; thus, they are a desirable target for malware. The following technical report gives an overview of how machine learning, especially neural networks, can be employed to detect malicious Android apps based on their metadata. Detection based on the metadata is necessary since not all of an app's information is readable from another app due to the security layout of Android. To do so, a comparable big dataset of metadata of apps has been collected for learning and evaluation in this work. The first section, after the introduction, presents the related work, followed by the description of the sources of the dataset and the selection of the features used for machine learning, in this case, only the app permissions. Afterward, a free available dataset is used to find an efficient and effective neural network model for learning and evaluation. Here, the fully connected network type consisting of dense layers is chosen. Then this model is trained and evaluated on the new, more extensive dataset to obtain a representative result. It turns out that this model detects malware with an accuracy of 92.93% based on an app's permissions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08547v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

To achieve this, we develop the most comprehensive (to the best of our knowledge) long-tailed learning benchmark named HeroLT, which integrates 13 state-of-the-art algorithms and 6 evaluation metrics on 14 real-world benchmark datasets across 4 tasks from 3 domains.

{"title":"Towards Stealthy Backdoor Attacks against Speech Recognition via Elements of Sound","description":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely and successfully adopted and deployed in various applications of speech recognition. Recently, a few works revealed that these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where the adversaries can implant malicious prediction behaviors into victim models by poisoning their training process. In this paper, we revisit poison-only backdoor attacks against speech recognition. We reveal that existing methods are not stealthy since their trigger patterns are perceptible to humans or machine detection. This limitation is mostly because their trigger patterns are simple noises or separable and distinctive clips. Motivated by these findings, we propose to exploit elements of sound ($e.g.$, pitch and timbre) to design more stealthy yet effective poison-only backdoor attacks. Specifically, we insert a short-duration high-pitched signal as the trigger and increase the pitch of remaining audio clips to `mask' it for designing stealthy pitch-based triggers. We manipulate timbre features of victim audios to design the stealthy timbre-based attack and design a voiceprint selection module to facilitate the multi-backdoor attack. Our attacks can generate more `natural' poisoned samples and therefore are more stealthy. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our attacks under different settings ($e.g.$, all-to-one, all-to-all, clean-label, physical, and multi-backdoor settings) and their stealthiness.

In this work, we present LuckyMera, a flexible, modular, extensible and configurable AI framework built around NetHack, a popular terminal-based, single-player roguelike video game.

However, widely used IFT datasets (e.g., Alpaca's 52k data) surprisingly contain many low-quality instances with incorrect or irrelevant responses, which are misleading and detrimental to IFT. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective data selection strategy that automatically identifies and removes low-quality data using a strong LLM (e.g., ChatGPT). To this end, we introduce AlpaGasus, which is finetuned on only 9k high-quality data filtered from the 52k Alpaca data.

{"title":"Shaping New Norms for Artificial Intelligence: A Complex Systems Perspective","description":"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, the need for new norms, encompassing both social conventions and formal regulation, becomes crucial. The task of developing such norms is challenging because the development of AI occurs at a much faster pace than the characteristic time of norm formation. Furthermore, this rapid speed makes it difficult to anticipate future scenarios. This paper examines the processes of norm formation surrounding AI from a complex systems perspective. Focusing on how new norms can be established, rather than on what these norms should be, it distinguishes different scenarios based on the centralisation or decentralisation of the norm formation process. In particular, the article highlights possible criticalities of the cases where new codes of behaviour are shaped by formal authorities, informal institutions, or emerge spontaneously in a bottom-up fashion. On the latter point, the paper reports a conversation that took place between the author and ChatGPT on May 22, 2023, in which the LLM discusses some of the emerging norms it has observed. Far from aiming at exhaustiveness, this article aims to offer readers some further interpretive tools to understand society's response to the growing pervasiveness of AI. The conclusion presents an outlook on how AI could influence the formation of future social norms and emphasises the importance for open societies to anchor their formal deliberation process in an open, inclusive, and transparent public discourse.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08564v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

The versatile applications enabled by ChatGPT offer immense value to users. However, assessing the performance of ChatGPT's output poses a challenge, particularly in scenarios where queries lack clear objective criteria for correctness. For instance, evaluating the quality of generated essays becomes arduous and relies heavily on manual labor, in stark contrast to evaluating solutions to well-defined, closed-ended questions such as mathematical problems.

To understand unfamiliar code, most software developers rely on general-purpose search engines to search through various programming information resources, which often requires multiple iterations of query rewriting and information foraging. More recently, developers have turned to online chatbots powered by LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which can provide more customized responses but also incur more overhead as developers need to communicate a significant amount of context to the LLM via a textual interface. In this study, we provide the investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI in the IDE. We aim to understand the promises and obstacles for tools powered by LLMs that are contextually aware, in that they automatically leverage the developer's programming context to answer queries.

Furthermore, although latent-based generative methods have shown great success in recent years, this particular model type remains underexplored in this area. In this work, we propose to apply flow matching in the latent spaces of pretrained autoencoders, which offers improved computational efficiency and scalability for high-resolution image synthesis. This enables flow-matching training on constrained computational resources while maintaining their quality and flexibility. Additionally, our work stands as a pioneering contribution in the integration of various conditions into flow matching for conditional generation tasks, including label-conditioned image generation, image inpainting, and semantic-to-image generation. Through extensive experiments, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in both quantitative and qualitative results on various datasets, such as CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, LSUN Church & Bedroom, and ImageNet.

{"title":"Overlapping Batch Confidence Intervals on Statistical Functionals Constructed from Time Series: Application to Quantiles, Optimization, and Estimation","description":"We propose a general purpose confidence interval procedure (CIP) for statistical functionals constructed using data from a stationary time series. The procedures we propose are based on derived distribution-free analogues of the $\\chi^2$ and Student's $t$ random variables for the statistical functional context, and hence apply in a wide variety of settings including quantile estimation, gradient estimation, M-estimation, CVAR-estimation, and arrival process rate estimation, apart from more traditional statistical settings. Like the method of subsampling, we use overlapping batches of time series data to estimate the underlying variance parameter; unlike subsampling and the bootstrap, however, we assume that the implied point estimator of the statistical functional obeys a central limit theorem (CLT) to help identify the weak asymptotics (called OB-x limits, x=I,II,III) of batched Studentized statistics. The OB-x limits, certain functionals of the Wiener process parameterized by the size of the batches and the extent of their overlap, form the essential machinery for characterizing dependence, and consequently the correctness of the proposed CIPs. The message from extensive numerical experimentation is that in settings where a functional CLT on the point estimator is in effect, using \\emph{large overlapping batches} alongside OB-x critical values yields confidence intervals that are often of significantly higher quality than those obtained from more generic methods like subsampling or the bootstrap. We illustrate using examples from CVaR estimation, ARMA parameter estimation, and NHPP rate estimation; R and MATLAB code for OB-x critical values is available at~\\texttt{web.ics.purdue.edu/~pasupath/}.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08609v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

In this paper, we study the human factors aspect of the human-swarm interaction and investigate how having access to high-quality data can affect the performance of the human-swarm system - the number of tasks completed and the human trust level in operation. We designed an experiment where a human operator is tasked to operate a swarm to identify casualties in an area within a given time period. One group of operators had the option to request high-quality pictures while the other group had to base their decision on the available low-quality images. We performed a user study with 120 participants and recorded their success rate (directly logged via the simulation platform) as well as their workload and trust level (measured through a questionnaire after completing a human-swarm scenario). The findings from our study indicated that the group granted access to high-quality data exhibited an increased workload and placed greater trust in the swarm, thus confirming our initial hypothesis. However, we also found that the number of accurately identified casualties did not significantly vary between the two groups, suggesting that data quality had no impact on the successful completion of tasks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08590v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Synthetic Lagrangian Turbulence by Generative Diffusion Models","description":"Lagrangian turbulence lies at the core of numerous applied and fundamental problems related to the physics of dispersion and mixing in engineering, bio-fluids, atmosphere, oceans, and astrophysics. Despite exceptional theoretical, numerical, and experimental efforts conducted over the past thirty years, no existing models are capable of faithfully reproducing statistical and topological properties exhibited by particle trajectories in turbulence. We propose a machine learning approach, based on a state-of-the-art Diffusion Model, to generate single-particle trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, thereby bypassing the need for direct numerical simulations or experiments to obtain reliable Lagrangian data. Our model demonstrates the ability to quantitatively reproduce all relevant statistical benchmarks over the entire range of time scales, including the presence of fat tails distribution for the velocity increments, anomalous power law, and enhancement of intermittency around the dissipative scale. The model exhibits good generalizability for extreme events, achieving unprecedented intensity and rarity. This paves the way for producing synthetic high-quality datasets for pre-training various downstream applications of Lagrangian turbulence.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08529v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Can We Trust Race Prediction?","description":"In the absence of sensitive race and ethnicity data, researchers, regulators, and firms alike turn to proxies. In this paper, I train a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model on a novel dataset of voter registration data from all 50 US states and create an ensemble that achieves up to 36.8% higher out of sample (OOS) F1 scores than the best performing machine learning models in the literature. Additionally, I construct the most comprehensive database of first and surname distributions in the US in order to improve the coverage and accuracy of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) and Bayesian Improved Firstname Surname Geocoding (BIFSG).

{"title":"Q(D)O-ES: Population-based Quality (Diversity) Optimisation for Post Hoc Ensemble Selection in AutoML","description":"Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems commonly ensemble models post hoc to improve predictive performance, typically via greedy ensemble selection (GES). However, we believe that GES may not always be optimal, as it performs a simple deterministic greedy search. In this work, we introduce two novel population-based ensemble selection methods, QO-ES and QDO-ES, and compare them to GES. While QO-ES optimises solely for predictive performance, QDO-ES also considers the diversity of ensembles within the population, maintaining a diverse set of well-performing ensembles during optimisation based on ideas of quality diversity optimisation. The methods are evaluated using 71 classification datasets from the AutoML benchmark, demonstrating that QO-ES and QDO-ES often outrank GES, albeit only statistically significant on validation data. Our results further suggest that diversity can be beneficial for post hoc ensembling but also increases the risk of overfitting.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08364v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation: Let's Talk About The Weather","description":"Current, self-supervised depth estimation architectures rely on clear and sunny weather scenes to train deep neural networks. However, in many locations, this assumption is too strong. For example in the UK (2021), 149 days consisted of rain. For these architectures to be effective in real-world applications, we must create models that can generalise to all weather conditions, times of the day and image qualities. Using a combination of computer graphics and generative models, one can augment existing sunny-weather data in a variety of ways that simulate adverse weather effects. While it is tempting to use such data augmentations for self-supervised depth, in the past this was shown to degrade performance instead of improving it. In this paper, we put forward a method that uses augmentations to remedy this problem. By exploiting the correspondence between unaugmented and augmented data we introduce a pseudo-supervised loss for both depth and pose estimation. This brings back some of the benefits of supervised learning while still not requiring any labels. We also make a series of practical recommendations which collectively offer a reliable, efficient framework for weather-related augmentation of self-supervised depth from monocular video. We present extensive testing to show that our method, Robust-Depth, achieves SotA performance on the KITTI dataset while significantly surpassing SotA on challenging, adverse condition data such as DrivingStereo, Foggy CityScape and NuScenes-Night.

{"title":"Efficient Computation of Counterfactual Bounds","description":"We assume to be given structural equations over discrete variables inducing a directed acyclic graph, namely, a structural causal model, together with data about its internal nodes. The question we want to answer is how we can compute bounds for partially identifiable counterfactual queries from such an input. We start by giving a map from structural casual models to credal networks. This allows us to compute exact counterfactual bounds via algorithms for credal nets on a subclass of structural causal models. Exact computation is going to be inefficient in general given that, as we show, causal inference is NP-hard even on polytrees. We target then approximate bounds via a causal EM scheme. We evaluate their accuracy by providing credible intervals on the quality of the approximation; we show through a synthetic benchmark that the EM scheme delivers accurate results in a fair number of runs. In the course of the discussion, we also point out what seems to be a neglected limitation to the trending idea that counterfactual bounds can be computed without knowledge of the structural equations. We also present a real case study on palliative care to show how our algorithms can readily be used for practical purposes.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08304v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Soft Prompt Tuning for Augmenting Dense Retrieval with Large Language Models","description":"Dense retrieval (DR) converts queries and documents into dense embeddings and measures the similarity between queries and documents in vector space. One of the challenges in DR is the lack of domain-specific training data. While DR models can learn from large-scale public datasets like MS MARCO through transfer learning, evidence shows that not all DR models and domains can benefit from transfer learning equally. Recently, some researchers have resorted to large language models (LLMs) to improve the zero-shot and few-shot DR models. However, the hard prompts or human-written prompts utilized in these works cannot guarantee the good quality of generated weak queries. To tackle this, we propose soft prompt tuning for augmenting DR (SPTAR): For each task, we leverage soft prompt-tuning to optimize a task-specific soft prompt on limited ground truth data and then prompt the LLMs to tag unlabeled documents with weak queries, yielding enough weak document-query pairs to train task-specific dense retrievers. We design a filter to select high-quality example document-query pairs in the prompt to further improve the quality of weak tagged queries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work utilizing soft prompt tuning to augment DR models. The experiments demonstrate that SPTAR outperforms the unsupervised baselines BM25 and the recently proposed LLMs-based augmentation method for DR.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08303v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Complexity Matters: Rethinking the Latent Space for Generative Modeling","description":"In generative modeling, numerous successful approaches leverage a low-dimensional latent space, e.g., Stable Diffusion models the latent space induced by an encoder and generates images through a paired decoder. Although the selection of the latent space is empirically pivotal, determining the optimal choice and the process of identifying it remain unclear. In this study, we aim to shed light on this under-explored topic by rethinking the latent space from the perspective of model complexity. Our investigation starts with the classic generative adversarial networks (GANs). Inspired by the GAN training objective, we propose a novel \"distance\" between the latent and data distributions, whose minimization coincides with that of the generator complexity. The minimizer of this distance is characterized as the optimal data-dependent latent that most effectively capitalizes on the generator's capacity. Then, we consider parameterizing such a latent distribution by an encoder network and propose a two-stage training strategy called Decoupled Autoencoder (DAE), where the encoder is only updated in the first stage with an auxiliary decoder and then frozen in the second stage while the actual decoder is being trained. DAE can improve the latent distribution and as a result, improve the generative performance. Our theoretical analyses are corroborated by comprehensive experiments on various models such as VQGAN and Diffusion Transformer, where our modifications yield significant improvements in sample quality with decreased model complexity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08283v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Extreme Image Compression using Fine-tuned VQGAN Models","description":"Recent advances in generative compression methods have demonstrated remarkable progress in enhancing the perceptual quality of compressed data, especially in scenarios with low bitrates. Nevertheless, their efficacy and applicability in achieving extreme compression ratios ($<0.1$ bpp) still remain constrained. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective coding framework by introducing vector quantization (VQ)-based generative models into the image compression domain. The main insight is that the codebook learned by the VQGAN model yields strong expressive capacity, facilitating efficient compression of continuous information in the latent space while maintaining reconstruction quality. Specifically, an image can be represented as VQ-indices by finding the nearest codeword, which can be encoded using lossless compression methods into bitstreams. We then propose clustering a pre-trained large-scale codebook into smaller codebooks using the K-means algorithm. This enables images to be represented as diverse ranges of VQ-indices maps, resulting in variable bitrates and different levels of reconstruction quality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art codecs in terms of perceptual quality-oriented metrics and human perception under extremely low bitrates.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08265v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Manifold-Guided Sampling in Diffusion Models for Unbiased Image Generation","description":"Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that can produce high-quality images, but they may suffer from data bias. Data bias occurs when the training data does not reflect the true distribution of the data domain, but rather exhibits some skewed or imbalanced patterns. For example, the CelebA dataset contains more female images than male images, which can lead to biased generation results and affect downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method to mitigate data bias in diffusion models by applying manifold guidance. Our key idea is to estimate the manifold of the training data using a learnable information-theoretic approach, and then use it to guide the sampling process of diffusion models. In this way, we can encourage the generated images to be uniformly distributed on the data manifold, without changing the model architecture or requiring labels or retraining. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to show that our method can improve the quality and unbiasedness of image generation compared to standard diffusion models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08199v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"A Novel Reversible Data Hiding Scheme Based on Asymmetric Numeral Systems","description":"Reversible data hiding (RDH) has been extensively studied in the field of information security. In our previous work [1], an explicit implementation approaching the rate-distortion bound of RDH has been proposed. However, there are two challenges left in our previous method. Firstly, this method suffers from computing precision problem due to the use of arithmetic coding, which may cause the further embedding impossible. Secondly, it had to transmit the probability distribution of the host signals during the embedding/extraction process, yielding quite additional overhead and application limitations. In this paper, we first propose an RDH scheme that employs our recent asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) variant as the underlying coding framework to avoid the computing precision problem. Then, we give a dynamic implementation that does not require transmitting the host distribution in advance. The simulation results show that the proposed static method provides slightly higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values than our previous work, and larger embedding capacity than some state-of-the-art methods on gray-scale images. In addition, the proposed dynamic method totally saves the explicit transmission of the host distribution and achieve data embedding at the cost of a small image quality loss.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08190v1","created":"2023-07-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
