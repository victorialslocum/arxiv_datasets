{"title":"A Multi-modal Garden Dataset and Hybrid 3D Dense Reconstruction Framework Based on Panoramic Stereo Images for a Trimming Robot","description":"Recovering an outdoor environment's surface mesh is vital for an agricultural robot during task planning and remote visualization. Our proposed solution is based on a newly-designed panoramic stereo camera along with a hybrid novel software framework that consists of three fusion modules. The panoramic stereo camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity maps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for the pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which effectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different nodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose graph. The refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory for volumetric fusion. In the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to produce the mesh of the whole garden. The proposed framework and its three fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the superiority of the performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06278v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

However, the lack of real-world sequential datasets limits research in this area. To address this issue, we introduce V2X-Seq, the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset, which includes data frames, trajectories, vector maps, and traffic lights captured from natural scenery. V2X-Seq comprises two parts: the sequential perception dataset, which includes more than 15,000 frames captured from 95 scenarios, and the trajectory forecasting dataset, which contains about 80,000 infrastructure-view scenarios, 80,000 vehicle-view scenarios, and 50,000 cooperative-view scenarios captured from 28 intersections' areas, covering 672 hours of data. Based on V2X-Seq, we introduce three new tasks for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative (VIC) autonomous driving: VIC3D Tracking, Online-VIC Forecasting, and Offline-VIC Forecasting.

Here, we propose WikiSQE, the first large-scale dataset for sentence quality estimation in Wikipedia.

WikiSQE has about 3.4 M sentences with 153 quality labels. In the experiment with automatic classification using competitive machine learning models, sentences that had problems with citation, syntax/semantics, or propositions were found to be more difficult to detect. In addition, we conducted automated essay scoring experiments to evaluate the generalizability of the dataset.

{"title":"Patchwork Learning: A Paradigm Towards Integrative Analysis across Diverse Biomedical Data Sources","description":"Machine learning (ML) in healthcare presents numerous opportunities for enhancing patient care, population health, and healthcare providers' workflows. However, the real-world clinical and cost benefits remain limited due to challenges in data privacy, heterogeneous data sources, and the inability to fully leverage multiple data modalities. In this perspective paper, we introduce \"patchwork learning\" (PL), a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations by integrating information from disparate datasets composed of different data modalities (e.g., clinical free-text, medical images, omics) and distributed across separate and secure sites. PL allows the simultaneous utilization of complementary data sources while preserving data privacy, enabling the development of more holistic and generalizable ML models. We present the concept of patchwork learning and its current implementations in healthcare, exploring the potential opportunities and applicable data sources for addressing various healthcare challenges. PL leverages bridging modalities or overlapping feature spaces across sites to facilitate information sharing and impute missing data, thereby addressing related prediction tasks. We discuss the challenges associated with PL, many of which are shared by federated and multimodal learning, and provide recommendations for future research in this field. By offering a more comprehensive approach to healthcare data integration, patchwork learning has the potential to revolutionize the clinical applicability of ML models. This paradigm promises to strike a balance between personalization and generalizability, ultimately enhancing patient experiences, improving population health, and optimizing healthcare providers' workflows.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06217v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Spectrum Breathing: Protecting Over-the-Air Federated Learning Against Interference","description":"Federated Learning (FL) is a widely embraced paradigm for distilling artificial intelligence from distributed mobile data. However, the deployment of FL in mobile networks can be compromised by exposure to interference from neighboring cells or jammers. Existing interference mitigation techniques require multi-cell cooperation or at least interference channel state information, which is expensive in practice. On the other hand, power control that treats interference as noise may not be effective due to limited power budgets, and also that this mechanism can trigger countermeasures by interference sources. As a practical approach for protecting FL against interference, we propose Spectrum Breathing, which cascades stochastic-gradient pruning and spread spectrum to suppress interference without bandwidth expansion. The cost is higher learning latency by exploiting the graceful degradation of learning speed due to pruning. We synchronize the two operations such that their levels are controlled by the same parameter, Breathing Depth. To optimally control the parameter, we develop a martingale-based approach to convergence analysis of Over-the-Air FL with spectrum breathing, termed AirBreathing FL. We show a performance tradeoff between gradient-pruning and interference-induced error as regulated by the breathing depth. Given receive SIR and model size, the optimization of the tradeoff yields two schemes for controlling the breathing depth that can be either fixed or adaptive to channels and the learning process. As shown by experiments, in scenarios where traditional Over-the-Air FL fails to converge in the presence of strong interference, AirBreahing FL with either fixed or adaptive breathing depth can ensure convergence where the adaptive scheme achieves close-to-ideal performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05933v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"DPMLBench: Holistic Evaluation of Differentially Private Machine Learning","description":"Differential privacy (DP), as a rigorous mathematical definition quantifying privacy leakage, has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection. Combined with powerful machine learning techniques, differentially private machine learning (DPML) is increasingly important. As the most classic DPML algorithm, DP-SGD incurs a significant loss of utility, which hinders DPML's deployment in practice. Many studies have recently proposed improved algorithms based on DP-SGD to mitigate utility loss. However, these studies are isolated and cannot comprehensively measure the performance of improvements proposed in algorithms. More importantly, there is a lack of comprehensive research to compare improvements in these DPML algorithms across utility, defensive capabilities, and generalizability.   We fill this gap by performing a holistic measurement of improved DPML algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference attacks (MIAs) on image classification tasks. We first present a taxonomy of where improvements are located in the machine learning life cycle. Based on our taxonomy, we jointly perform an extensive measurement study of the improved DPML algorithms. We also cover state-of-the-art label differential privacy (Label DP) algorithms in the evaluation. According to our empirical results, DP can effectively defend against MIAs, and sensitivity-bounding techniques such as per-sample gradient clipping play an important role in defense. We also explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against MIAs more effectively. Experiments show that Label DP algorithms achieve less utility loss but are fragile to MIAs. To support our evaluation, we implement a modular re-usable software, DPMLBench, which enables sensitive data owners to deploy DPML algorithms and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05900v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"Fast Distributed Inference Serving for Large Language Models","description":"Large language models (LLMs) power a new generation of interactive AI applications exemplified by ChatGPT. The interactive nature of these applications demand low job completion time (JCT) for model inference. Existing LLM serving systems use run-to-completion processing for inference jobs, which suffers from head-of-line blocking and long JCT. We present FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for LLMs. FastServe exploits the autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity of each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize JCT with a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi information-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the input length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each arrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are skipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management mechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate states between GPU memory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of FastServe based on NVIDIA FasterTransformer. Experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solution Orca, FastServe improves the average and tail JCT by up to 5.1$\\times$ and 6.4$\\times$, respectively.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05920v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

{"title":"Automatic Evaluation of Attribution by Large Language Models","description":"A recent focus of large language model (LLM) development, as exemplified by generative search engines, is to incorporate external references to generate and support their claims. However, evaluating the attribution, i.e., verifying whether the generated statement is indeed fully supported by the cited reference, remains an open problem. Although human evaluation is common practice, it is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we investigate the automatic evaluation of attribution by LLMs. We begin by providing a definition of attribution and then explore two approaches for automatic evaluation: prompting LLMs and fine-tuning smaller LMs. The fine-tuning data is repurposed from related tasks, such as question answering, fact-checking, natural language inference, and summarization. To facilitate the evaluation, we manually curate a set of test examples covering 12 domains from a generative search engine, New Bing. Our results on the curated test set and simulated test examples from existing benchmark questions highlight both promising signals as well as remaining challenges for the automatic evaluation of attribution. We hope our testbed, modeling methodology, and insights will help lay the foundation for future studies on this important problem.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06311v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}

{"title":"Differential Privacy for Protecting Private Patterns in Data Streams","description":"Complex event processing (CEP) is a powerful and increasingly more important tool to analyse data streams for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These data streams often contain private information that requires proper protection. However, privacy protection in CEP systems is still in its infancy, and most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPMs) are adopted from those designed for data streams. Such approaches undermine the quality of the entire data stream and limit the performance of IoT applications. In this paper, we attempt to break the limitation and establish a new foundation for PPMs of CEP by proposing a novel pattern-level differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We introduce two PPMs that guarantee pattern-level DP. They operate only on data that correlate with private patterns rather than on the entire data stream, leading to higher data quality. One of the PPMs provides adaptive privacy protection and brings more granularity and generalization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed PPMs with two experiments on a real-world dataset and on a synthetic dataset. The results of the experiments indicate that our proposed privacy guarantee and its PPMs can deliver better data quality under equally strong privacy guarantees, compared to multiple well-known PPMs designed for data streams.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06105v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Few-shot Link Prediction on N-ary Facts","description":"N-ary facts composed of a primary triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) and an arbitrary number of auxiliary attribute-value pairs, are prevalent in real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Link prediction on n-ary facts is to predict a missing element in an n-ary fact. This helps populate and enrich KGs and further promotes numerous downstream applications. Previous studies usually require a substantial amount of high-quality data to understand the elements in n-ary facts. However, these studies overlook few-shot relations, which have limited labeled instances, yet are common in real-world scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces a new task, few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts. It aims to predict a missing entity in an n-ary fact with limited labeled instances. We further propose a model for Few-shot Link prEdict on N-ary facts, thus called FLEN, which consists of three modules: the relation learning, support-specific adjusting, and query inference modules. FLEN captures relation meta information from limited instances to predict a missing entity in a query instance. To validate the effectiveness of FLEN, we construct three datasets based on existing benchmark data.

{"title":"Building Interoperable Electronic Health Records as Purpose-Driven Knowledge Graphs","description":"When building a new application we are increasingly confronted with the need of reusing and integrating pre-existing knowledge.

This is true also in domains, e.g., eHealth, where a lot of effort has been put into developing high-quality standards and reference ontologies, e.g. FHIR1. In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology, called iTelos, which enables data and knowledge reuse towards the construction of Interoperable Electronic Health Records (iEHR). The key intuition is that the data level and the schema level of an application should be developed independently, thus allowing for maximum flexibility in the reuse of the prior knowledge, but under the overall guidance of the needs to be satisfied, formalized as competence queries. This intuition is implemented by codifying all the requirements, including those concerning reuse, as part of a purpose defined a priori, which is then used to drive a middle-out development process where the application schema and data are continuously aligned.

We propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that requires only a relatively small number of annotations while being able to use the remaining unlabeled data to improve model performance. Our method uses a pseudo-labeling technique that employs recent deep learning uncertainty estimation models. By using the estimated uncertainty, we were able to rank pseudo-labels and automatically select the best pseudo-annotations generated by the supervised model. We applied this to prostate zonal segmentation in T2-weighted MRI scans. Our proposed model outperformed the semi-supervised model in experiments with the ProstateX dataset and an external test set, by leveraging only a subset of unlabeled data rather than the full collection of 4953 cases, our proposed model demonstrated improved performance.

In addition to ChinaOpen, we propose Generative Video-to-text Transformer (GVT) for Chinese video captioning. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art single-task / multi-task models on the new dataset, resulting in a number of novel findings and insights.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05880v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"V\u0101rta: A Large-Scale Headline-Generation Dataset for Indic Languages","description":"We present V\\=arta, a large-scale multilingual dataset for headline generation in Indic languages. This dataset includes 41.8 million news articles in 14 different Indic languages (and English), which come from a variety of high-quality sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest collection of curated articles for Indic languages currently available. We use the data collected in a series of experiments to answer important questions related to Indic NLP and multilinguality research in general. We show that the dataset is challenging even for state-of-the-art abstractive models and that they perform only slightly better than extractive baselines. Owing to its size, we also show that the dataset can be used to pretrain strong language models that outperform competitive baselines in both NLU and NLG benchmarks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05858v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Inclusive FinTech Lending via Contrastive Learning and Domain Adaptation","description":"FinTech lending (e.g., micro-lending) has played a significant role in facilitating financial inclusion. It has reduced processing times and costs, enhanced the user experience, and made it possible for people to obtain loans who may not have qualified for credit from traditional lenders. However, there are concerns about the potentially biased algorithmic decision-making during loan screening. Machine learning algorithms used to evaluate credit quality can be influenced by representation bias in the training data, as we only have access to the default outcome labels of approved loan applications, for which the borrowers' socioeconomic characteristics are better than those of rejected ones. In this case, the model trained on the labeled data performs well on the historically approved population, but does not generalize well to borrowers of low socioeconomic background. In this paper, we investigate the problem of representation bias in loan screening for a real-world FinTech lending platform. We propose a new Transformer-based sequential loan screening model with self-supervised contrastive learning and domain adaptation to tackle this challenging issue. We use contrastive learning to train our feature extractor on unapproved (unlabeled) loan applications and use domain adaptation to generalize the performance of our label predictor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experimentation in the real-world micro-lending setting. Our results show that our model significantly promotes the inclusiveness of funding decisions, while also improving loan screening accuracy and profit by 7.10% and 8.95%, respectively. We also show that incorporating the test data into contrastive learning and domain adaptation and labeling a small ratio of test data can further boost model performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05827v1","created":"2023-05-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
