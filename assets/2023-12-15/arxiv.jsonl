Prior work is often based on large proprietary data while publicly available datasets are few and small in size. In this study, we present WikiMuTe, a new and open dataset containing rich semantic descriptions of music. The data is sourced from Wikipedia's rich catalogue of articles covering musical works. Using a dedicated text-mining pipeline, we extract both long and short-form descriptions covering a wide range of topics related to music content such as genre, style, mood, instrumentation, and tempo. To show the use of this data, we train a model that jointly learns text and audio representations and performs cross-modal retrieval. The model is evaluated on two tasks: tag-based music retrieval and music auto-tagging. The results show that while our approach has state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks, but still observe a difference in performance depending on the data used for training.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09207v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"WIT-UAS: A Wildland-fire Infrared Thermal Dataset to Detect Crew Assets From Aerial Views","description":"We present the Wildland-fire Infrared Thermal (WIT-UAS) dataset for long-wave infrared sensing of crew and vehicle assets amidst prescribed wildland fire environments. While such a dataset is crucial for safety monitoring in wildland fire applications, to the authors' awareness, no such dataset focusing on assets near fire is publicly available. Presumably, this is due to the barrier to entry of collaborating with fire management personnel. We present two related data subsets: WIT-UAS-ROS consists of full ROS bag files containing sensor and robot data of UAS flight over the fire, and WIT-UAS-Image contains hand-labeled long-wave infrared (LWIR) images extracted from WIT-UAS-ROS. Our dataset is the first to focus on asset detection in a wildland fire environment. We show that thermal detection models trained without fire data frequently detect false positives by classifying fire as people. By adding our dataset to training, we show that the false positive rate is reduced significantly. Yet asset detection in wildland fire environments is still significantly more challenging than detection in urban environments, due to dense obscuring trees, greater heat variation, and overbearing thermal signal of the fire. We publicize this dataset to encourage the community to study more advanced models to tackle this challenging environment.

However, a major challenge in online learning is whether students are as engaged as they are in face-to-face classes. An engagement recognition system can significantly improve the learning experience in online classes. Current challenges in engagement detection involve poor label quality in the dataset, intra-class variation, and extreme data imbalance. To address these problems, we present the CMOSE dataset, which contains a large number of data in different engagement levels and high-quality labels generated according to the psychological advice. We demonstrate the advantage of transferability by analyzing the model performance on other engagement datasets. We also developed a training mechanism, MocoRank, to handle the intra-class variation, the ordinal relationship between different classes, and the data imbalance problem. MocoRank outperforms prior engagement detection losses, achieving a 1.32% enhancement in overall accuracy and 5.05% improvement in average accuracy. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modality by conducting ablation studies on features such as pre-trained video features, high-level facial features, and audio features.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09066v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"Entity-Augmented Code Generation","description":"The current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective in generating high-quality text and encapsulating a broad spectrum of world knowledge. However, these models often hallucinate during generation and are not designed to utilize external information sources. To enable requests to the external knowledge bases, also called knowledge grounding, retrieval-augmented LLMs were introduced. For now, their applications have largely involved Open Domain Question Answering, Abstractive Question Answering, and such. In this paper, we broaden the scope of retrieval-augmented LLMs by venturing into a new task - code generation using external entities. For this task, we collect and publish a new dataset for project-level code generation, where the model should reuse functions defined in the project during generation. As we show, existing retrieval-augmented LLMs fail to assign relevance scores between similar entity names, and to mitigate it, they expand entity names with description context and append it to the input. In practice, due to the limited context size they can not accommodate the indefinitely large context of the whole project. To solve this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable architecture with an scalable entity retriever injected directly into the LLM decoder. We demonstrate that our model can outperform common baselines in several scenarios, including project-level code generation, as well as Bash and SQL scripting.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08976v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Dataset Distillation via Adversarial Prediction Matching","description":"Dataset distillation is the technique of synthesizing smaller condensed datasets from large original datasets while retaining necessary information to persist the effect. In this paper, we approach the dataset distillation problem from a novel perspective: we regard minimizing the prediction discrepancy on the real data distribution between models, which are respectively trained on the large original dataset and on the small distilled dataset, as a conduit for condensing information from the raw data into the distilled version. An adversarial framework is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. In contrast to existing distillation methods involving nested optimization or long-range gradient unrolling, our approach hinges on single-level optimization. This ensures the memory efficiency of our method and provides a flexible tradeoff between time and memory budgets, allowing us to distil ImageNet-1K using a minimum of only 6.5GB of GPU memory. Under the optimal tradeoff strategy, it requires only 2.5$\\times$ less memory and 5$\\times$ less runtime compared to the state-of-the-art. Empirically, our method can produce synthetic datasets just 10% the size of the original, yet achieve, on average, 94% of the test accuracy of models trained on the full original datasets including ImageNet-1K, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art.

Employing intelligent automated precision livestock farming systems that can count animals, track the animals and their poses will raise productivity and significantly reduce the heavy burden on its already limited labor pool. To achieve such intelligent systems, a large cattle video dataset is essential in developing and training such models. However, many current animal datasets are tailored to few tasks or other types of animals, which result in poorer model performance when applied to cattle. Moreover, they do not provide top-down views of cattle. To address such limitations, we introduce CattleEyeView dataset, the first top-down view multi-task cattle video dataset for a variety of inter-related tasks (i.e., counting, detection, pose estimation, tracking, instance segmentation) that are useful to count the number of cows and assess their growth and well-being. The dataset contains 753 distinct top-down cow instances in 30,703 frames (14 video sequences). We perform benchmark experiments to evaluate the model's performance for each task.

{"title":"PROPRES: Investigating the Projectivity of Presupposition with Various Triggers and Environments","description":"What makes a presupposition of an utterance -- information taken for granted by its speaker -- different from other pragmatic inferences such as an entailment is projectivity (e.g., the negative sentence the boy did not stop shedding tears presupposes the boy had shed tears before). The projectivity may vary depending on the combination of presupposition triggers and environments. However, prior natural language understanding studies fail to take it into account as they either use no human baseline or include only negation as an entailment-canceling environment to evaluate models' performance. The current study attempts to reconcile these issues. We introduce a new dataset, projectivity of presupposition (PROPRES, which includes 12k premise-hypothesis pairs crossing six triggers involving some lexical variety with five environments. Our human evaluation reveals that humans exhibit variable projectivity in some cases. However, the model evaluation shows that the best-performed model, DeBERTa, does not fully capture it.

However, these crowdsourced annotated datasets often contain biases or dataset artifacts, leading to overestimated model performance and poor generalization. In this work, we focus on investigating dataset artifacts and developing strategies to address these issues. Through the utilization of a novel statistical testing procedure, we discover a significant association between vocabulary distribution and text entailment classes, emphasizing vocabulary as a notable source of biases. To mitigate these issues, we propose several automatic data augmentation strategies spanning character to word levels. By fine-tuning the ELECTRA pre-trained language model, we compare the performance of boosted models with augmented data against their baseline counterparts. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively enhance model accuracy and reduce biases by up to 0.66% and 1.14%, respectively.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08747v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

In this study, we present a new customized LLM solution with a modest parameter count of only 7B, achieving better performance than GPT-3.5 on two representative benchmarks for RTL code generation. This remarkable balance between accuracy and efficiency is made possible by leveraging our new RTL code dataset and a customized LLM algorithm, both of which will be made fully open-source. Furthermore, we have successfully quantized our LLM to 4-bit with a total size of 4GB, enabling it to function on a single laptop with only slight performance degradation.

{"title":"A Cyber-Physical Architecture for Microgrids based on Deep learning and LORA Technology","description":"This paper proposes a cyber-physical architecture for the secured social operation of isolated hybrid microgrids (HMGs). On the physical side of the proposed architecture, an optimal scheduling scheme considering various renewable energy sources (RESs) and fossil fuel-based distributed generation units (DGs) is proposed. Regarding the cyber layer of MGs, a wireless architecture based on low range wide area (LORA) technology is introduced for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart electricity grids. In the proposed architecture, the LORA data frame is described in detail and designed for the application of smart meters considering DGs and ac-dc converters. Additionally, since the cyber layer of smart grids is highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, t1his paper proposes a deep-learning-based cyber-attack detection model (CADM) based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) to detect false data injection attacks (FDIA) on the smart meters within AMI. The performance of the proposed energy management architecture is evaluated using the IEEE 33-bus test system. In order to investigate the effect of FDIA on the isolated HMGs and highlight the interactions between the cyber layer and physical layer, an FDIA is launched against the test system.

{"title":"Privacy Amplification by Iteration for ADMM with (Strongly) Convex Objective Functions","description":"We examine a private ADMM variant for (strongly) convex objectives which is a primal-dual iterative method. Each iteration has a user with a private function used to update the primal variable, masked by Gaussian noise for local privacy, without directly adding noise to the dual variable. Privacy amplification by iteration explores if noises from later iterations can enhance the privacy guarantee when releasing final variables after the last iteration. Cyffers et al. [ICML 2023] explored privacy amplification by iteration for the proximal ADMM variant, where a user's entire private function is accessed and noise is added to the primal variable. In contrast, we examine a private ADMM variant requiring just one gradient access to a user's function, but both primal and dual variables must be passed between successive iterations. To apply Balle et al.'s [NeurIPS 2019] coupling framework to the gradient ADMM variant, we tackle technical challenges with novel ideas. First, we address the non-expansive mapping issue in ADMM iterations by using a customized norm. Second, because the dual variables are not masked with any noise directly, their privacy guarantees are achieved by treating two consecutive noisy ADMM iterations as a Markov operator. Our main result is that the privacy guarantee for the gradient ADMM variant can be amplified proportionally to the number of iterations. For strongly convex objective functions, this amplification exponentially increases with the number of iterations. These amplification results align with the previously studied special case of stochastic gradient descent.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08685v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

{"title":"CogAgent: A Visual Language Model for GUI Agents","description":"People are spending an enormous amount of time on digital devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), e.g., computer or smartphone screens. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist people in tasks like writing emails, but struggle to understand and interact with GUIs, thus limiting their potential to increase automation levels. In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE. CogAgent, using only screenshots as input, outperforms LLM-based methods that consume extracted HTML text on both PC and Android GUI navigation tasks -- Mind2Web and AITW, advancing the state of the art.

{"title":"Evaluating Large Language Models for Health-related Queries with Presuppositions","description":"As corporations rush to integrate large language models (LLMs) to their search offerings, it is critical that they provide factually accurate information that is robust to any presuppositions that a user may express. In this work, we introduce UPHILL, a dataset consisting of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. Using UPHILL, we evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat models. We find that while model responses rarely disagree with true health claims (posed as questions), they often fail to challenge false claims: responses from InstructGPT agree with 32% of the false claims, ChatGPT 26% and BingChat 23%. As we increase the extent of presupposition in input queries, the responses from InstructGPT and ChatGPT agree with the claim considerably more often, regardless of its veracity. Responses from BingChat, which rely on retrieved webpages, are not as susceptible. Given the moderate factual accuracy, and the inability of models to consistently correct false assumptions, our work calls for a careful assessment of current LLMs for use in high-stakes scenarios.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08800v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

{"title":"Dietary Assessment with Multimodal ChatGPT: A Systematic Analysis","description":"Conventional approaches to dietary assessment are primarily grounded in self-reporting methods or structured interviews conducted under the supervision of dietitians. These methods, however, are often subjective, potentially inaccurate, and time-intensive. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions have been devised to automate the dietary assessment process, these prior AI methodologies encounter challenges in their ability to generalize across a diverse range of food types, dietary behaviors, and cultural contexts. This results in AI applications in the dietary field that possess a narrow specialization and limited accuracy. Recently, the emergence of multimodal foundation models such as GPT-4V powering the latest ChatGPT has exhibited transformative potential across a wide range of tasks (e.g., Scene understanding and image captioning) in numerous research domains. These models have demonstrated remarkable generalist intelligence and accuracy, capable of processing various data modalities. In this study, we explore the application of multimodal ChatGPT within the realm of dietary assessment. Our findings reveal that GPT-4V excels in food detection under challenging conditions with accuracy up to 87.5% without any fine-tuning or adaptation using food-specific datasets. By guiding the model with specific language prompts (e.g., African cuisine), it shifts from recognizing common staples like rice and bread to accurately identifying regional dishes like banku and ugali. Another GPT-4V's standout feature is its contextual awareness. GPT-4V can leverage surrounding objects as scale references to deduce the portion sizes of food items, further enhancing its accuracy in translating food weight into nutritional content. This alignment with the USDA National Nutrient Database underscores GPT-4V's potential to advance nutritional science and dietary assessment techniques.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08592v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""}}

We present FineControlNet to provide fine control over each instance's appearance while maintaining the precise pose control capability. Specifically, we develop and demonstrate FineControlNet with geometric control via human pose images and appearance control via instance-level text prompts. The spatial alignment of instance-specific text prompts and 2D poses in latent space enables the fine control capabilities of FineControlNet. We evaluate the performance of FineControlNet with rigorous comparison against state-of-the-art pose-conditioned text-to-image diffusion models.

Obtaining useful information from reliable sources in a limited time is crucial for LLM. Addressing this, our study introduces an LLM-based Q&A system for safety engineering, enhancing the comprehension and response accuracy of the model. We employed prompt engineering to incorporate external knowledge databases, thus enriching the LLM with up-to-date and reliable information. The system analyzes historical incident reports through statistical methods, utilizes vector embedding to construct a vector database, and offers an efficient similarity-based search functionality. Our findings indicate that the integration of external knowledge significantly augments the capabilities of LLM for in-depth problem analysis and autonomous task assignment. It effectively summarizes accident reports and provides pertinent recommendations.

{"title":"MotherNet: A Foundational Hypernetwork for Tabular Classification","description":"The advent of Foundation Models is transforming machine learning across many modalities (e.g., language, images, videos) with prompt engineering replacing training in many settings. Recent work on tabular data (e.g., TabPFN) hints at a similar opportunity to build Foundation Models for classification for numerical data. In this paper, we go one step further and propose a hypernetwork architecture that we call MotherNet, trained on millions of classification tasks, that, once prompted with a never-seen-before training set generates the weights of a trained ``child'' neural-network. Like other Foundation Models, MotherNet replaces training on specific datasets with in-context learning through a single forward pass. In contrast to existing hypernetworks that were either task-specific or trained for relatively constraint multi-task settings, MotherNet is trained to generate networks to perform multiclass classification on arbitrary tabular datasets without any dataset specific gradient descent.   The child network generated by MotherNet using in-context learning outperforms neural networks trained using gradient descent on small datasets, and is competitive with predictions by TabPFN and standard ML methods like Gradient Boosting. Unlike a direct application of transformer models like TabPFN, MotherNet generated networks are highly efficient at inference time. This methodology opens up a new approach to building predictive models on tabular data that is both efficient and robust, without any dataset-specific training.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08598v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"}}

On the one hand, it fine-tunes a pre-trained 2D diffusion model into a 3D diffusion model, enabling both 3D generative capabilities and generalization derived from the 2D model. On the other, it utilizes score distillation sampling of 2D diffusion models to quickly improve the quality of the sampled 3D shapes. PI3D enables the migration of knowledge from image to triplane generation by treating it as a set of pseudo-images. We adapt the modules in the pre-training model to enable hybrid training using pseudo and real images, which has proved to be a well-established strategy for improving generalizability. The efficiency of PI3D is highlighted by its ability to sample diverse 3D models in seconds and refine them in minutes. The experimental results confirm the advantages of PI3D over existing methods based on either 3D diffusion models or lifting 2D diffusion models in terms of fast generation of 3D consistent and high-quality models.

To address these problems, we present the CMOSE dataset, which contains a large number of data in different engagement levels and high-quality labels generated according to the psychological advice. We demonstrate the advantage of transferability by analyzing the model performance on other engagement datasets.

To mitigate this limitation, we present Holodeck, a system that generates 3D environments to match a user-supplied prompt fully automatedly. Holodeck can generate diverse scenes, e.g., arcades, spas, and museums, adjust the designs for styles, and can capture the semantics of complex queries such as \"apartment for a researcher with a cat\" and \"office of a professor who is a fan of Star Wars\". Holodeck leverages a large language model (GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like and uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene with diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects correctly, we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between objects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-scale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually designed procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can produce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an exciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI, training agents to navigate in novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data, which is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied agents.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09067v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

{"title":"Improving Cross-modal Alignment with Synthetic Pairs for Text-only Image Captioning","description":"Although image captioning models have made significant advancements in recent years, the majority of them heavily depend on high-quality datasets containing paired images and texts which are costly to acquire. Previous works leverage the CLIP's cross-modal association ability for image captioning, relying solely on textual information under unsupervised settings. However, not only does a modality gap exist between CLIP text and image features, but a discrepancy also arises between training and inference due to the unavailability of real-world images, which hinders the cross-modal alignment in text-only captioning. This paper proposes a novel method to address these issues by incorporating synthetic image-text pairs. A pre-trained text-to-image model is deployed to obtain images that correspond to textual data, and the pseudo features of generated images are optimized toward the real ones in the CLIP embedding space. Furthermore, textual information is gathered to represent image features, resulting in the image features with various semantics and the bridged modality gap. To unify training and inference, synthetic image features would serve as the training prefix for the language decoder, while real images are used for inference. Additionally, salient objects in images are detected as assistance to enhance the learning of modality alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08865v1","created":"2023-12-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

In this paper, we specifically delve into these issues and propose Distance-weighted Auto-regularized Neural network (DAN), a novel extreme-adaptive model for long-range forecasting of stremflow enhanced by polar representation learning. DAN utilizes a distance-weighted multi-loss mechanism and stackable blocks to dynamically refine indicator sequences from exogenous data, while also being able to handle uni-variate time-series by employing Gaussian Mixture probability modeling to improve robustness to severe events. We also introduce Kruskal-Wallis sampling and gate control vectors to handle imbalanced extreme data.

Current methods either disregard priors and directly fitting end-to-end networks, leading to inconsistent illumination, or rely on unreliable handcrafted priors to constrain the network, thereby bringing the greater error to the final result. We believe in the strength of data-driven high-quality priors and strive to offer a reliable and consistent prior, circumventing the restrictions of manual priors. In this paper, we propose Clearer Night Image Restoration with Vector-Quantized Codebook (VQCNIR) to achieve remarkable and consistent restoration outcomes on real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To ensure the faithful restoration of details and illumination, we propose the incorporation of two essential modules: the Adaptive Illumination Enhancement Module (AIEM) and the Deformable Bi-directional Cross-Attention (DBCA) module. The AIEM leverages the inter-channel correlation of features to dynamically maintain illumination consistency between degraded features and high-quality codebook features. Meanwhile, the DBCA module effectively integrates texture and structural information through bi-directional cross-attention and deformable convolution, resulting in enhanced fine-grained detail and structural fidelity across parallel decoders.
