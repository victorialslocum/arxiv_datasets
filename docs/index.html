                  Many complex systems often contain interactions between more than two nodes, known as higher-order interactions, which can change the structure of these systems in significant ways. Researchers often assume that all interactions paint a consistent picture of a higher-order dataset's structure. In contrast, the connection patterns of individuals or entities in empirical systems are often stratified by interaction size. Ignoring this fact can aggregate connection patterns that exist only at certain scales of interaction. To isolate these scale-dependent patterns, we present an approach for analyzing higher-order datasets by filtering interactions by their size. We apply this framework to several empirical datasets from three domains to demonstrate that data practitioners can gain valuable information from this approach.

                Spectral Clustering on Large Datasets: When Does it Work? Theory from Continuous Clustering and Density Cheeger-Buser

                  Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms that has stood the test of time. It is simple to describe, can be implemented using standard linear algebra, and often finds better clusters than traditional clustering algorithms like $k$-means and $k$-centers. The foundational algorithm for two-way spectral clustering, by Shi and Malik, creates a geometric graph from data and finds a spectral cut of the graph.   In modern machine learning, many data sets are modeled as a large number of points drawn from a probability density function. Little is known about when spectral clustering works in this setting -- and when it doesn't. Past researchers justified spectral clustering by appealing to the graph Cheeger inequality (which states that the spectral cut of a graph approximates the ``Normalized Cut''), but this justification is known to break down on large data sets.   We provide theoretically-informed intuition about spectral clustering on large data sets drawn from probability densities, by proving when a continuous form of spectral clustering considered by past researchers (the unweighted spectral cut of a probability density) finds good clusters of the underlying density itself. Our work suggests that Shi-Malik spectral clustering works well on data drawn from mixtures of Laplace distributions, and works poorly on data drawn from certain other densities, such as a density we call the `square-root trough'.   Our core theorem proves that weighted spectral cuts have low weighted isoperimetry for all probability densities. Our key tool is a new Cheeger-Buser inequality for all probability densities, including discontinuous ones.

                  Visual localization plays an important role in the positioning and navigation of robotics systems within previously visited environments. When visits occur over long periods of time, changes in the environment related to seasons or day-night cycles present a major challenge. Under water, the sources of variability are due to other factors such as water conditions or growth of marine organisms. Yet it remains a major obstacle and a much less studied one, partly due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new deep-sea dataset to benchmark underwater long-term visual localization. The dataset is composed of images from four visits to the same hydrothermal vent edifice over the course of five years. Camera poses and a common geometry of the scene were estimated using navigation data and Structure-from-Motion. This serves as a reference when evaluating visual localization techniques. An analysis of the data provides insights about the major changes observed throughout the years. Furthermore, several well-established visual localization methods are evaluated on the dataset, showing there is still room for improvement in underwater long-term visual localization. The data is made publicly available at https://www.seanoe.org/data/00810/92226/.

                  This dataset contains 10,000 fluid flow and heat transfer simulations in U-bend shapes. Each of them is described by 28 design parameters, which are processed with the help of Computational Fluid Dynamics methods. The dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for investigating various problems and methods from the field of design optimization. For these investigations supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning approaches can be employed. One unique feature of this dataset is that each shape can be represented by three distinct data types including design parameter and objective combinations, five different resolutions of 2D images from the geometry and the solution variables of the numerical simulation, as well as a representation using the cell values of the numerical mesh. This third representation enables considering the specific data structure of numerical simulations for deep learning approaches. The source code and the container used to generate the data are published as part of this work.

                  Emergent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities promise to improve performance and explainability of large language models (LLMs). However, uncertainties remain about how prompting strategies formulated for previous model generations generalize to new model generations and different datasets. In this small-scale study we compare the performance of a range of zero-shot prompts for inducing CoT reasoning across six recently released LLMs (davinci-002, davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5-xxl and Cohere command-xlarge) on a mixture of six question-answering datasets, including datasets from scientific and medical domains. We find that a CoT prompt that was previously discovered through automated prompt discovery shows robust performance across experimental conditions and produces best results when applied to the state-of-the-art model GPT-4.

                  Video super-resolution (VSR) techniques, especially deep-learning-based algorithms, have drastically improved over the last few years and shown impressive performance on synthetic data. However, their performance on real-world video data suffers because of the complexity of real-world degradations and misaligned video frames. Since obtaining a synthetic dataset consisting of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) frames are easier than obtaining real-world LR and HR images, in this paper, we propose synthesizing real-world degradations on synthetic training datasets. The proposed synthetic real-world degradations (SRWD) include a combination of the blur, noise, downsampling, pixel binning, and image and video compression artifacts. We then propose using a random shuffling-based strategy to simulate these degradations on the training datasets and train a single end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) on the proposed larger variation of realistic synthesized training data. Our quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis shows that the proposed training strategy using diverse realistic degradations improves the performance by 7.1 % in terms of NRQM compared to RealBasicVSR and by 3.34 % compared to BSRGAN on the VideoLQ dataset. We also introduce a new dataset that contains high-resolution real-world videos that can serve as a common ground for bench-marking.

                  Most deepfake detection methods focus on detecting spatial and/or spatio-temporal changes in facial attributes. This is because available benchmark datasets contain mostly visual-only modifications. However, a sophisticated deepfake may include small segments of audio or audio-visual manipulations that can completely change the meaning of the content. To addresses this gap, we propose and benchmark a new dataset, Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF), consisting of strategic content-driven audio, visual and audio-visual manipulations. The proposed baseline method, Boundary Aware Temporal Forgery Detection (BA-TFD), is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based architecture which efficiently captures multimodal manipulations. We further improve (i.e. BA-TFD+) the baseline method by replacing the backbone with a Multiscale Vision Transformer and guide the training process with contrastive, frame classification, boundary matching and multimodal boundary matching loss functions. The quantitative analysis demonstrates the superiority of BA- TFD+ on temporal forgery localization and deepfake detection tasks using several benchmark datasets including our newly proposed dataset. The dataset, models and code are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/LAV-DF.

                  In recent years, raw video denoising has garnered increased attention due to the consistency with the imaging process and well-studied noise modeling in the raw domain. However, two problems still hinder the denoising performance. Firstly, there is no large dataset with realistic motions for supervised raw video denoising, as capturing noisy and clean frames for real dynamic scenes is difficult. To address this, we propose recapturing existing high-resolution videos displayed on a 4K screen with high-low ISO settings to construct noisy-clean paired frames. In this way, we construct a video denoising dataset (named as ReCRVD) with 120 groups of noisy-clean videos, whose ISO values ranging from 1600 to 25600. Secondly, while non-local temporal-spatial attention is beneficial for denoising, it often leads to heavy computation costs. We propose an efficient raw video denoising transformer network (RViDeformer) that explores both short and long-distance correlations. Specifically, we propose multi-branch spatial and temporal attention modules, which explore the patch correlations from local window, local low-resolution window, global downsampled window, and neighbor-involved window, and then they are fused together. We employ reparameterization to reduce computation costs. Our network is trained in both supervised and unsupervised manners, achieving the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the model trained with our proposed dataset (ReCRVD) outperforms the model trained with previous benchmark dataset (CRVD) when evaluated on the real-world outdoor noisy videos. Our code and dataset will be released after the acceptance of this work.

                  The MIND dataset is at the moment of writing the most extensive dataset available for the research and development of news recommender systems. This work analyzes the suitability of the dataset for research on diverse news recommendations. On the one hand we analyze the effect the different steps in the recommendation pipeline have on the distribution of article categories, and on the other hand we check whether the supplied data would be sufficient for more sophisticated diversity analysis. We conclude that while MIND is a great step forward, there is still a lot of room for improvement.

                  Document-based Visual Question Answering examines the document understanding of document images in conditions of natural language questions. We proposed a new document-based VQA dataset, PDF-VQA, to comprehensively examine the document understanding from various aspects, including document element recognition, document layout structural understanding as well as contextual understanding and key information extraction. Our PDF-VQA dataset extends the current scale of document understanding that limits on the single document page to the new scale that asks questions over the full document of multiple pages. We also propose a new graph-based VQA model that explicitly integrates the spatial and hierarchically structural relationships between different document elements to boost the document structural understanding. The performances are compared with several baselines over different question types and tasks\footnote{The full dataset will be released after paper acceptance.

                  Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website. We hope that SportsPose will allow researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more effective models for the analysis of sports performance and injury prevention. With its realistic and diverse dataset, SportsPose provides a valuable resource for advancing the state-of-the-art in pose estimation in sports.

                  Relation extraction is a central task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research. We argue that an important type of relation not explored in NLP or IR research to date is that of an event being an argument - required or optional - of another event. We introduce the human-annotated Event Dependency Relation dataset (EDeR) which provides this dependency relation. The annotation is done on a sample of documents from the OntoNotes dataset, which has the added benefit that it integrates with existing, orthogonal, annotations of this dataset. We investigate baseline approaches for predicting the event dependency relation, the best of which achieves an accuracy of 82.61 for binary argument/non-argument classification. We show that recognizing this relation leads to more accurate event extraction (semantic role labelling) and can improve downstream tasks that depend on this, such as co-reference resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predicting the three-way classification into the required argument, optional argument or non-argument is a more challenging task.

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.

                  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its effectiveness in segmenting any object/part in various 2D images, yet its ability for 3D has not been fully explored. The real world is composed of numerous 3D scenes and objects. Due to the scarcity of accessible 3D data and high cost of its acquisition and annotation, lifting SAM to 3D is a challenging but valuable research avenue. With this in mind, we propose a novel framework to Segment Anything in 3D, named SA3D. Given a neural radiance field (NeRF) model, SA3D allows users to obtain the 3D segmentation result of any target object via only one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view. With input prompts, SAM cuts out the target object from the according view. The obtained 2D segmentation mask is projected onto 3D mask grids via density-guided inverse rendering. 2D masks from other views are then rendered, which are mostly uncompleted but used as cross-view self-prompts to be fed into SAM again. Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning. The entire segmentation process can be completed in approximately two minutes without any engineering optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SA3D in different scenes, highlighting the potential of SAM in 3D scene perception. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/.

                  In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a novel method for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and answer genomics questions. Specifically, we prompt Codex (code-davinci-002) to solve the GeneTuring tests with few-shot URL requests of NCBI API calls as demonstrations for in-context learning. During inference, we stop the decoding once a call request is detected and make the API call with the generated URL. We then append the raw execution results returned by NCBI APIs to the generated texts and continue the generation until the answer is found or another API call is detected. Our preliminary results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on three out of four one-shot tasks and four out of five zero-shot tasks in the GeneTuring dataset. Overall, GeneGPT achieves a macro-average score of 0.76, which is much higher than retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the New Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as other LLMs such as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12).

                  An open source software package for simulating thermal neutron propagation in geometry is presented. In this system, neutron propagation can be treated by either the particle transport method or the ray-tracing method. Supported by an accurate backend scattering physics engine, this system is capable of reproducing neutron scattering experiments in complex geometries and is expected to be used in the areas of instrument characterisation, optimisation and data analysis.   In this paper, the relevant theories are briefly introduced. The simulation flow and the user input syntax to control it are provided in detail. Five benchmarking simulations, focusing on different aspects of simulation and scattering techniques, are given to demonstrate the applications of this simulation system. They include an idealised total scattering instrument, a monochromatic powder diffractometer, a neutron guide, a chopper and an imaging setup for complex geometries. Simulated results are benchmarked against experimental data or well-established software packages when appropriate. Good agreements are observed.

                  Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                Large Language Models in the Workplace: A Case Study on Prompt Engineering for Job Type Classification

                  This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.

                  Explaining the black-box predictions of NLP models naturally and accurately is an important open problem in natural language generation. These free-text explanations are expected to contain sufficient and carefully-selected evidence to form supportive arguments for predictions. Due to the superior generative capacity of large pretrained language models, recent work built on prompt engineering enables explanation generation without specific training. However, explanation generated through single-pass prompting often lacks sufficiency and conciseness. To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise. Our approach regenerates the free-text explanation by polishing the single-pass output from the pretrained language model but retaining the information that supports the contents being explained. Experiments on two out-of-domain tasks verify the effectiveness of EIB through automatic evaluation and thoroughly-conducted human evaluation.

                Fill in the Blank: Context-aware Automated Text Input Generation for Mobile GUI Testing

                  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

                Multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A

                  We present a multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A within the internal shock scenario. We consider the time-dependent evolution of the outflow with its impact on the observed light curve from multiple collisions, and the self-consistent generation of the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\sim1$~s. We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum. Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.
