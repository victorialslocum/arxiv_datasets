                  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in utilizing external APIs as tools for various tasks. However, their tool-using ability is limited by the availability of suitable APIs and the instability of implicit reasoning, particularly when simultaneously engaging in reasoning about plans and actual calculations. To address these limitations, we propose CREATOR, a novel framework that empowers LLMs to create their own tools through documentation and code realization. CREATOR disentangles the LLM's ability into two distinct phases: abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution, which results in improved LLM performance. We evaluate CREATOR on two established benchmarks: MATH, which consists of challenging math competition problems, and TabMWP, which includes diverse tabular contents for problem-solving. Remarkably, CREATOR significantly outperforms existing chain-of-thought (CoT), program-of-thought (PoT), and tool-using baselines on these two benchmarks. Additionally, we present a new dataset, Creation Challenge, comprising 2K diverse questions, to highlight the necessity and benefits of LLMs' tool creation ability in effectively addressing these problems. Furthermore, our research reveals that leveraging LLMs as tool creators facilitates knowledge transfer, and LLMs exhibit varying levels of tool creation abilities, enabling them to flexibly tackle diverse situations. Our study represents a promising avenue for maximizing the potential of LLMs and advancing toward truly intelligent and adaptable AI systems.

                  This dissertation presents a methodology for recording speed climbing training sessions with multiple cameras and annotating the videos with relevant data, including body position, hand and foot placement, and timing. The annotated data is then analyzed using deep learning techniques to create a standard dataset of speed climbing training videos. The results demonstrate the potential of the new dataset for improving speed climbing training and research, including identifying areas for improvement, creating personalized training plans, and analyzing the effects of different training methods.The findings will also be applied to the training process of the Jiangxi climbing team through further empirical research to test the findings and further explore the feasibility of this study.

                  Language identification (LID) is a fundamental step in many natural language processing pipelines. However, current LID systems are far from perfect, particularly on lower-resource languages. We present a LID model which achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.93 and a false positive rate of 0.033 across 201 languages, outperforming previous work. We achieve this by training on a curated dataset of monolingual data, the reliability of which we ensure by auditing a sample from each source and each language manually. We make both the model and the dataset available to the research community. Finally, we carry out detailed analysis into our model's performance, both in comparison to existing open models and by language class.

                  We present CALLS, a Japanese speech corpus that considers phone calls in a customer center as a new domain of empathetic spoken dialogue. The existing STUDIES corpus covers only empathetic dialogue between a teacher and student in a school. To extend the application range of empathetic dialogue speech synthesis (EDSS), we designed our corpus to include the same female speaker as the STUDIES teacher, acting as an operator in simulated phone calls. We describe a corpus construction methodology and analyze the recorded speech. We also conduct EDSS experiments using the CALLS and STUDIES corpora to investigate the effect of domain differences. The results show that mixing the two corpora during training causes biased improvements in the quality of synthetic speech due to the different degrees of expressiveness. Our project page of the corpus is http://sython.org/Corpus/STUDIES-2.

                Detection of Cross-Dataset Fake Audio Based on Prosodic and Pronunciation Features

                  Existing fake audio detection systems perform well in in-domain testing, but still face many challenges in out-of-domain testing. This is due to the mismatch between the training and test data, as well as the poor generalizability of features extracted from limited views. To address this, we propose multi-view features for fake audio detection, which aim to capture more generalized features from prosodic, pronunciation, and wav2vec dimensions. Specifically, the phoneme duration features are extracted from a pre-trained model based on a large amount of speech data. For the pronunciation features, a Conformer-based phoneme recognition model is first trained, keeping the acoustic encoder part as a deeply embedded feature extractor. Furthermore, the prosodic and pronunciation features are fused with wav2vec features based on an attention mechanism to improve the generalization of fake audio detection models. Results show that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains in several cross-dataset experiments.

                  Semantic segmentation of drone images is critical to many aerial vision tasks as it provides essential semantic details that can compensate for the lack of depth information from monocular cameras. However, maintaining high accuracy of semantic segmentation models for drones requires diverse, large-scale, and high-resolution datasets, which are rare in the field of aerial image processing. Existing datasets are typically small and focus primarily on urban scenes, neglecting rural and industrial areas. Models trained on such datasets are not sufficiently equipped to handle the variety of inputs seen in drone imagery. In the VDD-Varied Drone Dataset, we offer a large-scale and densely labeled dataset comprising 400 high-resolution images that feature carefully chosen scenes, camera angles, and varied light and weather conditions. Furthermore, we have adapted existing drone datasets to conform to our annotation standards and integrated them with VDD to create a dataset 1.5 times the size of fine annotation of Cityscapes. We have developed a novel DeepLabT model, which combines CNN and Transformer backbones, to provide a reliable baseline for semantic segmentation in drone imagery. Our experiments indicate that DeepLabT performs admirably on VDD and other drone datasets. We expect that our dataset will generate considerable interest in drone image segmentation and serve as a foundation for other drone vision tasks. VDD is freely available on our website at https://vddvdd.com .

                  Modern software systems heavily rely on external libraries developed by third-parties to ensure efficient development. However, frequent library upgrades can lead to compatibility issues between the libraries and their client systems. In this paper, we introduce CompSuite, a dataset that includes 123 real-world Java client-library pairs where upgrading the library causes an incompatibility issue in the corresponding client. Each incompatibility issue in CompSuite is associated with a test case authored by the developers, which can be used to reproduce the issue. The dataset also provides a command-line interface that simplifies the execution and validation of each issue. With this infrastructure, users can perform an inspection of any incompatibility issue with the push of a button, or reproduce an issue step-by-step for a more detailed investigation. We make CompSuite publicly available to promote open science. We believe that various software analysis techniques, such as compatibility checking, debugging, and regression test selection, can benefit from CompSuite.

                  Cloud-native databases have become the de-facto choice for mission-critical applications on the cloud due to the need for high availability, resource elasticity, and cost efficiency. Meanwhile, driven by the increasing connectivity between data generation and analysis, users prefer a single database to efficiently process both OLTP and OLAP workloads, which enhances data freshness and reduces the complexity of data synchronization and the overall business cost.   In this paper, we summarize five crucial design goals for a cloud-native HTAP database based on our experience and customers' feedback, i.e., transparency, competitive OLAP performance, minimal perturbation on OLTP workloads, high data freshness, and excellent resource elasticity. As our solution to realize these goals, we present PolarDB-IMCI, a cloud-native HTAP database system designed and deployed at Alibaba Cloud. Our evaluation results show that PolarDB-IMCI is able to handle HTAP efficiently on both experimental and production workloads; notably, it speeds up analytical queries up to $\times149$ on TPC-H (100 $GB$). PolarDB-IMCI introduces low visibility delay and little performance perturbation on OLTP workloads (< 5%), and resource elasticity can be achieved by scaling out in tens of seconds.

                  In real world applications, knowledge graphs (KG) are widely used in various domains (e.g. medical applications and dialogue agents). However, for fact verification, KGs have not been adequately utilized as a knowledge source. KGs can be a valuable knowledge source in fact verification due to their reliability and broad applicability. A KG consists of nodes and edges which makes it clear how concepts are linked together, allowing machines to reason over chains of topics. However, there are many challenges in understanding how these machine-readable concepts map to information in text. To enable the community to better use KGs, we introduce a new dataset, FactKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs. It consists of 108k natural language claims with five types of reasoning: One-hop, Conjunction, Existence, Multi-hop, and Negation. Furthermore, FactKG contains various linguistic patterns, including colloquial style claims as well as written style claims to increase practicality. Lastly, we develop a baseline approach and analyze FactKG over these reasoning types. We believe FactKG can advance both reliability and practicality in KG-based fact verification.

                  Wikipedia can be edited by anyone and thus contains various quality sentences. Therefore, Wikipedia includes some poor-quality edits, which are often marked up by other editors. While editors' reviews enhance the credibility of Wikipedia, it is hard to check all edited text. Assisting in this process is very important, but a large and comprehensive dataset for studying it does not currently exist. Here, we propose WikiSQE, the first large-scale dataset for sentence quality estimation in Wikipedia. Each sentence is extracted from the entire revision history of Wikipedia, and the target quality labels were carefully investigated and selected. WikiSQE has about 3.4 M sentences with 153 quality labels. In the experiment with automatic classification using competitive machine learning models, sentences that had problems with citation, syntax/semantics, or propositions were found to be more difficult to detect. In addition, we conducted automated essay scoring experiments to evaluate the generalizability of the dataset. We show that the models trained on WikiSQE perform better than the vanilla model, indicating its potential usefulness in other domains. WikiSQE is expected to be a valuable resource for other tasks in NLP.

                  Visual localization plays an important role in the positioning and navigation of robotics systems within previously visited environments. When visits occur over long periods of time, changes in the environment related to seasons or day-night cycles present a major challenge. Under water, the sources of variability are due to other factors such as water conditions or growth of marine organisms. Yet it remains a major obstacle and a much less studied one, partly due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new deep-sea dataset to benchmark underwater long-term visual localization. The dataset is composed of images from four visits to the same hydrothermal vent edifice over the course of five years. Camera poses and a common geometry of the scene were estimated using navigation data and Structure-from-Motion. This serves as a reference when evaluating visual localization techniques. An analysis of the data provides insights about the major changes observed throughout the years. Furthermore, several well-established visual localization methods are evaluated on the dataset, showing there is still room for improvement in underwater long-term visual localization. The data is made publicly available at https://www.seanoe.org/data/00810/92226/.

The dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for investigating various problems and methods from the field of design optimization. For these investigations supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning approaches can be employed. One unique feature of this dataset is that each shape can be represented by three distinct data types including design parameter and objective combinations, five different resolutions of 2D images from the geometry and the solution variables of the numerical simulation, as well as a representation using the cell values of the numerical mesh. This third representation enables considering the specific data structure of numerical simulations for deep learning approaches. The source code and the container used to generate the data are published as part of this work.

                  Empowering chatbots in the field of mental health is receiving increasing amount of attention, while there still lacks exploration in developing and evaluating chatbots in psychiatric outpatient scenarios. In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots for psychiatrist and patient simulation. We collaborate with psychiatrists to identify objectives and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. In the evaluation experiments, we recruit real psychiatrists and patients to engage in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT-powered chatbots in psychiatric scenarios and explore the impact of prompt designs on chatbot behavior and user experience.

                  In this paper, we present ZeroPrompt (Figure 1-(a)) and the corresponding Prompt-and-Refine strategy (Figure 3), two simple but effective \textbf{training-free} methods to decrease the Token Display Time (TDT) of streaming ASR models \textbf{without any accuracy loss}. The core idea of ZeroPrompt is to append zeroed content to each chunk during inference, which acts like a prompt to encourage the model to predict future tokens even before they were spoken. We argue that streaming acoustic encoders naturally have the modeling ability of Masked Language Models and our experiments demonstrate that ZeroPrompt is engineering cheap and can be applied to streaming acoustic encoders on any dataset without any accuracy loss. Specifically, compared with our baseline models, we achieve 350 $\sim$ 700ms reduction on First Token Display Time (TDT-F) and 100 $\sim$ 400ms reduction on Last Token Display Time (TDT-L), with theoretically and experimentally equal WER on both Aishell-1 and Librispeech datasets.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  Large language models (LLMs) have shown surprisingly good performance in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) even when trained without parallel data. Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data is gigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly for low-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages on LLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how should we mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x ChrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate the importance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as the superiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.

                  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its effectiveness in segmenting any object/part in various 2D images, yet its ability for 3D has not been fully explored. The real world is composed of numerous 3D scenes and objects. Due to the scarcity of accessible 3D data and high cost of its acquisition and annotation, lifting SAM to 3D is a challenging but valuable research avenue. With this in mind, we propose a novel framework to Segment Anything in 3D, named SA3D. Given a neural radiance field (NeRF) model, SA3D allows users to obtain the 3D segmentation result of any target object via only one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view. With input prompts, SAM cuts out the target object from the according view. The obtained 2D segmentation mask is projected onto 3D mask grids via density-guided inverse rendering. 2D masks from other views are then rendered, which are mostly uncompleted but used as cross-view self-prompts to be fed into SAM again. Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning. The entire segmentation process can be completed in approximately two minutes without any engineering optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SA3D in different scenes, highlighting the potential of SAM in 3D scene perception. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/.

                  In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a novel method for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and answer genomics questions. Specifically, we prompt Codex (code-davinci-002) to solve the GeneTuring tests with few-shot URL requests of NCBI API calls as demonstrations for in-context learning. During inference, we stop the decoding once a call request is detected and make the API call with the generated URL. We then append the raw execution results returned by NCBI APIs to the generated texts and continue the generation until the answer is found or another API call is detected. Our preliminary results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on three out of four one-shot tasks and four out of five zero-shot tasks in the GeneTuring dataset. Overall, GeneGPT achieves a macro-average score of 0.76, which is much higher than retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the New Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as other LLMs such as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12).

                  Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

                LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models

                  The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                Large Language Models in the Workplace: A Case Study on Prompt Engineering for Job Type Classification

                  This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.

                  Explaining the black-box predictions of NLP models naturally and accurately is an important open problem in natural language generation. These free-text explanations are expected to contain sufficient and carefully-selected evidence to form supportive arguments for predictions. Due to the superior generative capacity of large pretrained language models, recent work built on prompt engineering enables explanation generation without specific training. However, explanation generated through single-pass prompting often lacks sufficiency and conciseness. To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise. Our approach regenerates the free-text explanation by polishing the single-pass output from the pretrained language model but retaining the information that supports the contents being explained. Experiments on two out-of-domain tasks verify the effectiveness of EIB through automatic evaluation and thoroughly-conducted human evaluation.

                  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.
