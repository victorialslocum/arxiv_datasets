                  Supervised 3D Object Detection models have been displaying increasingly better performance in single-domain cases where the training data comes from the same environment and sensor as the testing data. However, in real-world scenarios data from the target domain may not be available for finetuning or for domain adaptation methods. Indeed, 3D object detection models trained on a source dataset with a specific point distribution have shown difficulties in generalizing to unseen datasets. Therefore, we decided to leverage the information available from several annotated source datasets with our Multi-Dataset Training for 3D Object Detection (MDT3D) method to increase the robustness of 3D object detection models when tested in a new environment with a different sensor configuration. To tackle the labelling gap between datasets, we used a new label mapping based on coarse labels. Furthermore, we show how we managed the mix of datasets during training and finally introduce a new cross-dataset augmentation method: cross-dataset object injection. We demonstrate that this training paradigm shows improvements for different types of 3D object detection models.

                  An event-based camera outputs an event whenever a change in scene brightness of a preset magnitude is detected at a particular pixel location in the sensor plane. The resulting sparse and asynchronous output coupled with the high dynamic range and temporal resolution of this novel camera motivate the study of event-based cameras for navigation and landing applications. However, the lack of real-world and synthetic datasets to support this line of research has limited its consideration for onboard use. This paper presents a methodology and a software pipeline for generating event-based vision datasets from optimal landing trajectories during the approach of a target body. We construct sequences of photorealistic images of the lunar surface with the Planet and Asteroid Natural Scene Generation Utility at different viewpoints along a set of optimal descent trajectories obtained by varying the boundary conditions. The generated image sequences are then converted into event streams by means of an event-based camera emulator. We demonstrate that the pipeline can generate realistic event-based representations of surface features by constructing a dataset of 500 trajectories, complete with event streams and motion field ground truth data. We anticipate that novel event-based vision datasets can be generated using this pipeline to support various spacecraft pose reconstruction problems given events as input, and we hope that the proposed methodology would attract the attention of researchers working at the intersection of neuromorphic vision and guidance navigation and control.

                  The rise of large language models (LLMs) had a transformative impact on search, ushering in a new era of search engines that are capable of generating search results in natural language text, imbued with citations for supporting sources. Building generative information-seeking models demands openly accessible datasets, which currently remain lacking. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, HAGRID (Human-in-the-loop Attributable Generative Retrieval for Information-seeking Dataset) for building end-to-end generative information-seeking models that are capable of retrieving candidate quotes and generating attributed explanations. Unlike recent efforts that focus on human evaluation of black-box proprietary search engines, we built our dataset atop the English subset of MIRACL, a publicly available information retrieval dataset. HAGRID is constructed based on human and LLM collaboration. We first automatically collect attributed explanations that follow an in-context citation style using an LLM, i.e. GPT-3.5. Next, we ask human annotators to evaluate the LLM explanations based on two criteria: informativeness and attributability. HAGRID serves as a catalyst for the development of information-seeking models with better attribution capabilities.

                  In the field of phase change phenomena, the lack of accessible and diverse datasets suitable for machine learning (ML) training poses a significant challenge. Existing experimental datasets are often restricted, with limited availability and sparse ground truth data, impeding our understanding of this complex multi-physics phenomena. To bridge this gap, we present the BubbleML Dataset(https://github.com/HPCForge/BubbleML) which leverages physics-driven simulations to provide accurate ground truth information for various boiling scenarios, encompassing nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled boiling. This extensive dataset covers a wide range of parameters, including varying gravity conditions, flow rates, sub-cooling levels, and wall superheat, comprising 51 simulations. BubbleML is validated against experimental observations and trends, establishing it as an invaluable resource for ML research. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to facilitate exploration of diverse downstream tasks by introducing two benchmarks: (a) optical flow analysis to capture bubble dynamics, and (b) operator networks for learning temperature dynamics. The BubbleML dataset and its benchmarks serve as a catalyst for advancements in ML-driven research on multi-physics phase change phenomena, enabling the development and comparison of state-of-the-art techniques and models.

                  There is a growing interest in device-control systems that can interpret human natural language instructions and execute them on a digital device by directly controlling its user interface. We present a dataset for device-control research, Android in the Wild (AITW), which is orders of magnitude larger than current datasets. The dataset contains human demonstrations of device interactions, including the screens and actions, and corresponding natural language instructions. It consists of 715k episodes spanning 30k unique instructions, four versions of Android (v10-13),and eight device types (Pixel 2 XL to Pixel 6) with varying screen resolutions. It contains multi-step tasks that require semantic understanding of language and visual context. This dataset poses a new challenge: actions available through the user interface must be inferred from their visual appearance. And, instead of simple UI element-based actions, the action space consists of precise gestures (e.g., horizontal scrolls to operate carousel widgets). We organize our dataset to encourage robustness analysis of device-control systems, i.e., how well a system performs in the presence of new task descriptions, new applications, or new platform versions. We develop two agents and report performance across the dataset. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/android_in_the_wild.

                  Dataset Condensation aims to condense a large dataset into a smaller one while maintaining its ability to train a well-performing model, thus reducing the storage cost and training effort in deep learning applications. However, conventional dataset condensation methods are optimization-oriented and condense the dataset by performing gradient or parameter matching during model optimization, which is computationally intensive even on small datasets and models. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset condensation method based on distribution matching, which is more efficient and promising. Specifically, we identify two important shortcomings of naive distribution matching (i.e., imbalanced feature numbers and unvalidated embeddings for distance computation) and address them with three novel techniques (i.e., partitioning and expansion augmentation, efficient and enriched model sampling, and class-aware distribution regularization). Our simple yet effective method outperforms most previous optimization-oriented methods with much fewer computational resources, thereby scaling data condensation to larger datasets and models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are available at https://github.com/uitrbn/IDM

                  Human Pose Estimation is a thoroughly researched problem; however, most datasets focus on the side and front-view scenarios. We address the limitation by proposing a novel approach that tackles the challenges posed by extreme viewpoints and poses. We introduce a new method for synthetic data generation - RePoGen, RarE POses GENerator - with comprehensive control over pose and view to augment the COCO dataset. Experiments on a new dataset of real images show that adding RePoGen data to the COCO surpasses previous attempts to top-view pose estimation and significantly improves performance on the bottom-view dataset. Through an extensive ablation study on both the top and bottom view data, we elucidate the contributions of methodological choices and demonstrate improved performance. The code and the datasets are available on the project website.

                  Autonomous driving on water surfaces plays an essential role in executing hazardous and time-consuming missions, such as maritime surveillance, survivors rescue, environmental monitoring, hydrography mapping and waste cleaning. This work presents WaterScenes, the first multi-task 4D radar-camera fusion dataset for autonomous driving on water surfaces. Equipped with a 4D radar and a monocular camera, our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) proffers all-weather solutions for discerning object-related information, including color, shape, texture, range, velocity, azimuth, and elevation. Focusing on typical static and dynamic objects on water surfaces, we label the camera images and radar point clouds at pixel-level and point-level, respectively. In addition to basic perception tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, we also provide annotations for free-space segmentation and waterline segmentation. Leveraging the multi-task and multi-modal data, we conduct numerous experiments on the single modality of radar and camera, as well as the fused modalities. Results demonstrate that 4D radar-camera fusion can considerably enhance the robustness of perception on water surfaces, especially in adverse lighting and weather conditions. WaterScenes dataset is public on https://waterscenes.github.io.

                  Visual anomaly detection is essential and commonly used for many tasks in the field of computer vision. Recent anomaly detection datasets mainly focus on industrial automated inspection, medical image analysis and video surveillance. In order to broaden the application and research of anomaly detection in unmanned supermarkets and smart manufacturing, we introduce the supermarket goods anomaly detection (GoodsAD) dataset. It contains 6124 high-resolution images of 484 different appearance goods divided into 6 categories. Each category contains several common different types of anomalies such as deformation, surface damage and opened. Anomalies contain both texture changes and structural changes. It follows the unsupervised setting and only normal (defect-free) images are used for training. Pixel-precise ground truth regions are provided for all anomalies. Moreover, we also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. This initial benchmark indicates that some methods which perform well on the industrial anomaly detection dataset (e.g., MVTec AD), show poor performance on our dataset. This is a comprehensive, multi-object dataset for supermarket goods anomaly detection that focuses on real-world applications.

                  With the increasing adoption of robots across industries, it is crucial to focus on developing advanced algorithms that enable robots to anticipate, comprehend, and plan their actions effectively in collaboration with humans. We introduce the Robot Autonomous Motion (RoAM) video dataset, which is collected with a custom-made turtlebot3 Burger robot in a variety of indoor environments recording various human motions from the robot's ego-vision. The dataset also includes synchronized records of the LiDAR scan and all control actions taken by the robot as it navigates around static and moving human agents. The unique dataset provides an opportunity to develop and benchmark new visual prediction frameworks that can predict future image frames based on the action taken by the recording agent in partially observable scenarios or cases where the imaging sensor is mounted on a moving platform. We have benchmarked the dataset on our novel deep visual prediction framework called ACPNet where the approximated future image frames are also conditioned on action taken by the robot and demonstrated its potential for incorporating robot dynamics into the video prediction paradigm for mobile robotics and autonomous navigation research.

                  This paper describes a method for using Grovers algorithm to create a quantum vector database, the database stores embeddings based on Controlled-S gates, which represent a binary numerical value. This value represents the embeddings value. The process of creating meaningful embeddings is handled by a classical computer and the search process is handled by the quantum computer. This search approach might be beneficial for a large enough database, or it could be seen as a very qubit-efficient (super dense) way for storing data on a quantum computer, since the proposed circuit stores many embeddings inside one quantum register simultaneously.

                  Mentions of new concepts appear regularly in texts and require automated approaches to harvest and place them into Knowledge Bases (KB), e.g., ontologies and taxonomies. Existing datasets suffer from three issues, (i) mostly assuming that a new concept is pre-discovered and cannot support out-of-KB mention discovery; (ii) only using the concept label as the input along with the KB and thus lacking the contexts of a concept label; and (iii) mostly focusing on concept placement w.r.t a taxonomy of atomic concepts, instead of complex concepts, i.e., with logical operators. To address these issues, we propose a new benchmark, adapting MedMentions dataset (PubMed abstracts) with SNOMED CT versions in 2014 and 2017 under the Diseases sub-category and the broader categories of Clinical finding, Procedure, and Pharmaceutical / biologic product. We provide usage on the evaluation with the dataset for out-of-KB mention discovery and concept placement, adapting recent Large Language Model based methods.

                  This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified. A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly evolving field of content generation.

                  The recently released ChatGPT model demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in zero-shot question-answering. In this work, we probe ChatGPT for its conversational understanding and introduce a conversational framework (protocol) that can be adopted in future studies. The Pok\'emon universe serves as an ideal testing ground for auditing ChatGPT's reasoning capabilities due to its closed world assumption. After bringing ChatGPT's background knowledge (on the Pok\'emon universe) to light, we test its reasoning process when using these concepts in battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability to acquire new knowledge and include it in its reasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to assess ChatGPT's ability to generalize, combine features, and to acquire and reason over newly introduced knowledge from human feedback. We find that ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe, which can reason upon in battle scenarios to a great extent, even when new information is introduced. The model performs better with collaborative feedback and if there is an initial phase of information retrieval, but also hallucinates occasionally and is susceptible to adversarial attacks.

                  Existing text summarization systems have made significant progress in recent years but typically generates summaries in a single step. The one-shot summarization setting is sometimes inadequate, however, as the generated summary may contain hallucinations or overlook important details related to the reader's interests. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing SummIt, an iterative text summarization framework based on large language models like ChatGPT. Our framework enables the model to refine the generated summary iteratively through self-evaluation and feedback, closely resembling the iterative process humans undertake when drafting and revising summaries. We also explore using in-context learning to guide the rationale generation and summary refinement. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating knowledge and topic extractors into the framework to enhance summary faithfulness and controllability. We evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark summarization datasets through empirical and qualitative analyses. We also conduct a human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the model's refinements and find a potential issue of over-correction.

In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots for psychiatrist and patient simulation. We collaborate with psychiatrists to identify objectives and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. In the evaluation experiments, we recruit real psychiatrists and patients to engage in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT-powered chatbots in psychiatric scenarios and explore the impact of prompt designs on chatbot behavior and user experience.

                  In this paper, we present ZeroPrompt (Figure 1-(a)) and the corresponding Prompt-and-Refine strategy (Figure 3), two simple but effective \textbf{training-free} methods to decrease the Token Display Time (TDT) of streaming ASR models \textbf{without any accuracy loss}. The core idea of ZeroPrompt is to append zeroed content to each chunk during inference, which acts like a prompt to encourage the model to predict future tokens even before they were spoken. We argue that streaming acoustic encoders naturally have the modeling ability of Masked Language Models and our experiments demonstrate that ZeroPrompt is engineering cheap and can be applied to streaming acoustic encoders on any dataset without any accuracy loss. Specifically, compared with our baseline models, we achieve 350 $\sim$ 700ms reduction on First Token Display Time (TDT-F) and 100 $\sim$ 400ms reduction on Last Token Display Time (TDT-L), with theoretically and experimentally equal WER on both Aishell-1 and Librispeech datasets.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                Artificial muses: Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Have Risen to Human-Level Creativity

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                  For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt learning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize prompt learning with the visual knowledge and view images and the corresponding prompts as patch and token sets under optimal transport, which pushes the prompt tokens to faithfully capture the label-specific visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. Moreover, the proposed model can also be straightforwardly extended to the conditional case where the instance-conditional prompts are generated to improve the generalizability. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model.
