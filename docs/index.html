                  Compositional generalization allows efficient learning and human-like inductive biases. Since most research investigating compositional generalization in NLP is done on English, important questions remain underexplored. Do the necessary compositional generalization abilities differ across languages? Can models compositionally generalize cross-lingually? As a first step to answering these questions, recent work used neural machine translation to translate datasets for evaluating compositional generalization in semantic parsing. However, we show that this entails critical semantic distortion. To address this limitation, we craft a faithful rule-based translation of the MCWQ dataset from English to Chinese and Japanese. Even with the resulting robust benchmark, which we call MCWQ-R, we show that the distribution of compositions still suffers due to linguistic divergences, and that multilingual models still struggle with cross-lingual compositional generalization. Our dataset and methodology will be useful resources for the study of cross-lingual compositional generalization in other tasks.

                  Pre-trained Vision-Language Foundation Models utilizing extensive image-text paired data have demonstrated unprecedented image-text association capabilities, achieving remarkable results across various downstream tasks. A critical challenge is how to make use of existing large-scale pre-trained VLMs, which are trained on common objects, to perform the domain-specific transfer for accomplishing domain-related downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new framework that includes the Domain Foundation Model (DFM), bridging the gap between the General Foundation Model (GFM) and domain-specific downstream tasks. Moreover, we present an image-text paired dataset in the field of remote sensing (RS), RS5M, which has 5 million RS images with English descriptions. The dataset is obtained from filtering publicly available image-text paired datasets and captioning label-only RS datasets with pre-trained VLM. These constitute the first large-scale RS image-text paired dataset. Additionally, we tried several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods on RS5M to implement the DFM. Experimental results show that our proposed dataset are highly effective for various tasks, improving upon the baseline by $8 \% \sim 16 \%$ in zero-shot classification tasks, and obtaining good results in both Vision-Language Retrieval and Semantic Localization tasks. Finally, we show successful results of training the RS Stable Diffusion model using the RS5M, uncovering more use cases of the dataset.

                  Machine learning approaches often require training and evaluation datasets with a clear separation between positive and negative examples. This risks simplifying and even obscuring the inherent subjectivity present in many tasks. Preserving such variance in content and diversity in datasets is often expensive and laborious. This is especially troubling when building safety datasets for conversational AI systems, as safety is both socially and culturally situated. To demonstrate this crucial aspect of conversational AI safety, and to facilitate in-depth model performance analyses, we introduce the DICES (Diversity In Conversational AI Evaluation for Safety) dataset that contains fine-grained demographic information about raters, high replication of ratings per item to ensure statistical power for analyses, and encodes rater votes as distributions across different demographics to allow for in-depth explorations of different aggregation strategies. In short, the DICES dataset enables the observation and measurement of variance, ambiguity, and diversity in the context of conversational AI safety. We also illustrate how the dataset offers a basis for establishing metrics to show how raters' ratings can intersects with demographic categories such as racial/ethnic groups, age groups, and genders. The goal of DICES is to be used as a shared resource and benchmark that respects diverse perspectives during safety evaluation of conversational AI systems.

                  Current perceptual similarity metrics operate at the level of pixels and patches. These metrics compare images in terms of their low-level colors and textures, but fail to capture mid-level similarities and differences in image layout, object pose, and semantic content. In this paper, we develop a perceptual metric that assesses images holistically. Our first step is to collect a new dataset of human similarity judgments over image pairs that are alike in diverse ways. Critical to this dataset is that judgments are nearly automatic and shared by all observers. To achieve this we use recent text-to-image models to create synthetic pairs that are perturbed along various dimensions. We observe that popular perceptual metrics fall short of explaining our new data, and we introduce a new metric, DreamSim, tuned to better align with human perception. We analyze how our metric is affected by different visual attributes, and find that it focuses heavily on foreground objects and semantic content while also being sensitive to color and layout. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, our metric generalizes to real images, giving strong results on retrieval and reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, our metric outperforms both prior learned metrics and recent large vision models on these tasks.

                  Recent advances in neural reconstruction enable high-quality 3D object reconstruction from casually captured image collections. Current techniques mostly analyze their progress on relatively simple image collections where Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques can provide ground-truth (GT) camera poses. We note that SfM techniques tend to fail on in-the-wild image collections such as image search results with varying backgrounds and illuminations. To enable systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction from casual image captures, we propose NAVI: a new dataset of category-agnostic image collections of objects with high-quality 3D scans along with per-image 2D-3D alignments providing near-perfect GT camera parameters. These 2D-3D alignments allow us to extract accurate derivative annotations such as dense pixel correspondences, depth and segmentation maps. We demonstrate the use of NAVI image collections on different problem settings and show that NAVI enables more thorough evaluations that were not possible with existing datasets. We believe NAVI is beneficial for systematic research progress on 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation. Project page: https://navidataset.github.io

                  The state of the art of many learning tasks, e.g., image classification, is advanced by collecting larger datasets and then training larger models on them. As the outcome, the increasing computational cost is becoming unaffordable. In this paper, we investigate how to prune the large-scale datasets, and thus produce an informative subset for training sophisticated deep models with negligible performance drop. We propose a simple yet effective dataset pruning method by exploring both the prediction uncertainty and training dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to study dataset pruning on large-scale datasets, i.e., ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K, and advanced models, i.e., Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method outperforms the state of the art and achieves 75% lossless compression ratio on both ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K.

                  To promote the development of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) and multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) in the Chinese community, we firstly release the largest public Chinese high-quality video-language dataset named Youku-mPLUG, which is collected from Youku, a well-known Chinese video-sharing website, with strict criteria of safety, diversity, and quality. Youku-mPLUG contains 10 million Chinese video-text pairs filtered from 400 million raw videos across a wide range of 45 diverse categories for large-scale pre-training. In addition, to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of video-language models, we carefully build the largest human-annotated Chinese benchmarks covering three popular video-language tasks of cross-modal retrieval, video captioning, and video category classification. Youku-mPLUG can enable researchers to conduct more in-depth multimodal research and develop better applications in the future. Furthermore, we release popular video-language pre-training models, ALPRO and mPLUG-2, and our proposed modularized decoder-only model mPLUG-video pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG. Experiments show that models pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG gain up to 23.1% improvement in video category classification. Besides, mPLUG-video achieves a new state-of-the-art result on these benchmarks with 80.5% top-1 accuracy in video category classification and 68.9 CIDEr score in video captioning, respectively. Finally, we scale up mPLUG-video based on the frozen Bloomz with only 1.7% trainable parameters as Chinese multimodal LLM, and demonstrate impressive instruction and video understanding ability. The zero-shot instruction understanding experiment indicates that pretraining with Youku-mPLUG can enhance the ability to comprehend overall and detailed visual semantics, recognize scene text, and leverage open-domain knowledge.

                  While homomorphic encryption (HE) has garnered significant research interest in cloud-based outsourced databases due to its algebraic properties over ciphertexts, the computational overhead associated with HE has hindered its widespread adoption in production database systems. Recently, a caching technique called Radix-based additive caching of homomorphic encryption (Rache) was proposed in SIGMOD'23. The primary objective of this paper is to address the performance overhead resulting from the expensive randomization process in Rache. To achieve this, we propose a novel encryption algorithm called $ASEnc$, which replaces the computationally intensive full scan of radixes with the caching of a polynomial number of radix-powers during an offline stage. This design significantly reduces the performance impact caused by randomization. Furthermore, this paper aims to extend Rache's capabilities to support floating-point numbers. To accomplish this, we introduce a new encryption algorithm named $FSEnc$, leveraging efficient constant multiplication available in state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. Notably, $FSEnc$ offers the flexibility to cache the coefficients instead of the radixes themselves, which may result in a large number of cached ciphertexts. However, we manage this efficiently by streaming the dynamically cached ciphertexts through a vector of circular buffers. We demonstrate that both encryption algorithms guarantee semantic security (IND-CPA). To validate their performance, we implement both algorithms as loadable functions in MySQL 8.0 and deploy the system prototype on a 96-core server hosted in the Chameleon Cloud. Experimental results showcase that $ASEnc$ outperforms Rache by 2.3--3.3$\times$, while $FSEnc$ surpasses the state-of-the-art floating-point FHE CKKS by 1.8--5.6$\times$.

                  This study introduces a novel approach to generate dance motions using onomatopoeia as input, with the aim of enhancing creativity and diversity in dance generation. Unlike text and music, onomatopoeia conveys rhythm and meaning through abstract word expressions without constraints on expression and without need for specialized knowledge. We adapt the AI Choreographer framework and employ the Sakamoto system, a feature extraction method for onomatopoeia focusing on phonemes and syllables. Additionally, we present a new dataset of 40 onomatopoeia-dance motion pairs collected through a user survey. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables more intuitive dance generation and can create dance motions using sound-symbolic words from a variety of languages, including those without onomatopoeia. This highlights the potential for diverse dance creation across different languages and cultures, accessible to a wider audience. Qualitative samples from our model can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/onomatopoeia-dance/home/.

                  We investigate knowledge retrieval with multi-modal queries, i.e. queries containing information split across image and text inputs, a challenging task that differs from previous work on cross-modal retrieval. We curate a new dataset called ReMuQ for benchmarking progress on this task. ReMuQ requires a system to retrieve knowledge from a large corpus by integrating contents from both text and image queries. We introduce a retriever model ``ReViz'' that can directly process input text and images to retrieve relevant knowledge in an end-to-end fashion without being dependent on intermediate modules such as object detectors or caption generators. We introduce a new pretraining task that is effective for learning knowledge retrieval with multimodal queries and also improves performance on downstream tasks. We demonstrate superior performance in retrieval on two datasets (ReMuQ and OK-VQA) under zero-shot settings as well as further improvements when finetuned on these datasets.

                  Face recognition systems have significantly advanced in recent years, driven by the availability of large-scale datasets. However, several issues have recently came up, including privacy concerns that have led to the discontinuation of well-established public datasets. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a solution, even though current synthesis methods present other drawbacks such as limited intra-class variations, lack of realism, and unfair representation of demographic groups. This study introduces GANDiffFace, a novel framework for the generation of synthetic datasets for face recognition that combines the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models to overcome the limitations of existing synthetic datasets. In GANDiffFace, we first propose the use of GANs to synthesize highly realistic identities and meet target demographic distributions. Subsequently, we fine-tune Diffusion models with the images generated with GANs, synthesizing multiple images of the same identity with a variety of accessories, poses, expressions, and contexts. We generate multiple synthetic datasets by changing GANDiffFace settings, and compare their mated and non-mated score distributions with the distributions provided by popular real-world datasets for face recognition, i.e. VGG2 and IJB-C. Our results show the feasibility of the proposed GANDiffFace, in particular the use of Diffusion models to enhance the (limited) intra-class variations provided by GANs towards the level of real-world datasets.

                  With a surge in identifying suicidal risk and its severity in social media posts, we argue that a more consequential and explainable research is required for optimal impact on clinical psychology practice and personalized mental healthcare. The success of computational intelligence techniques for inferring mental illness from social media resources, points to natural language processing as a lens for determining Interpersonal Risk Factors (IRF) in human writings. Motivated with limited availability of datasets for social NLP research community, we construct and release a new annotated dataset with human-labelled explanations and classification of IRF affecting mental disturbance on social media: (i) Thwarted Belongingness (TBe), and (ii) Perceived Burdensomeness (PBu). We establish baseline models on our dataset facilitating future research directions to develop real-time personalized AI models by detecting patterns of TBe and PBu in emotional spectrum of user's historical social media profile.

                  ChatGPT can improve Software Engineering (SE) research practices by offering efficient, accessible information analysis and synthesis based on natural language interactions. However, ChatGPT could bring ethical challenges, encompassing plagiarism, privacy, data security, and the risk of generating biased or potentially detrimental data. This research aims to fill the given gap by elaborating on the key elements: motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature survey, identified the mentioned elements, and presented their relationships by developing a taxonomy. Further, the identified literature-based elements (motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles) were empirically evaluated by conducting a comprehensive questionnaire-based survey involving SE researchers. Additionally, we employed Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) approach to analyze the relationships between the ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research and develop a level based decision model. We further conducted a Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to create a cluster-based decision model. These models aim to help SE researchers devise effective strategies for ethically integrating ChatGPT into SE research by following the identified principles through adopting the motivators and addressing the demotivators. The findings of this study will establish a benchmark for incorporating ChatGPT services in SE research with an emphasis on ethical considerations.

In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots for psychiatrist and patient simulation. We collaborate with psychiatrists to identify objectives and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. In the evaluation experiments, we recruit real psychiatrists and patients to engage in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT-powered chatbots in psychiatric scenarios and explore the impact of prompt designs on chatbot behavior and user experience.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  Large language models (LLMs) have shown surprisingly good performance in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) even when trained without parallel data. Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data is gigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly for low-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages on LLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how should we mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x ChrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate the importance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as the superiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  An open source software package for simulating thermal neutron propagation in geometry is presented. In this system, neutron propagation can be treated by either the particle transport method or the ray-tracing method. Supported by an accurate backend scattering physics engine, this system is capable of reproducing neutron scattering experiments in complex geometries and is expected to be used in the areas of instrument characterisation, optimisation and data analysis.   In this paper, the relevant theories are briefly introduced. The simulation flow and the user input syntax to control it are provided in detail. Five benchmarking simulations, focusing on different aspects of simulation and scattering techniques, are given to demonstrate the applications of this simulation system. They include an idealised total scattering instrument, a monochromatic powder diffractometer, a neutron guide, a chopper and an imaging setup for complex geometries. Simulated results are benchmarked against experimental data or well-established software packages when appropriate. Good agreements are observed.

                  The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

                Artificial muses: Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Have Risen to Human-Level Creativity

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                  The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly conversational LLMs like ChatGPT, have prompted changes in a range of fields, including design. This study aims to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in a human-centered design process. To this end, a hypothetical design project was conducted, where ChatGPT was utilized to generate personas, simulate interviews with fictional users, create new design ideas, simulate usage scenarios and conversations between an imaginary prototype and fictional users, and lastly evaluate user experience. The results show that ChatGPT effectively performed the tasks assigned to it as a designer, user, or product, providing mostly appropriate responses. The study does, however, highlight some drawbacks such as forgotten information, partial responses, and a lack of output diversity. The paper explains the potential benefits and limitations of using conversational LLMs in design, discusses its implications, and suggests directions for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

                  Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.
