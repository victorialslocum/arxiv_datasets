                  Since the beginning of robotic interplanetary exploration nearly six decades ago, successful atmospheric entry has been accomplished at Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Titan. More entry probe missions are planned to Venus, Titan, and Uranus in the next decade. Atmospheric entry subjects the vehicle to rapid deceleration and aerothermal loads which the vehicle must be designed for, to deliver the robotic instruments inside the atmosphere. The design of planetary probes and their mission architecture is complex, and involves various engineering constraints such as peak deceleration, heating rate, heating load, and communications which must be satisfied within the budget and schedule of cost constrained mission opportunities. Engineering design data from previous entry probe missions serve as a valuable reference for designing future missions. The present study compiles an augmented version of the blue book entry probe dataset, performs a comparative analysis of the entry conditions, and provides engineering rules of thumb for design of future missions. Using the dataset, the present study proposes a new empirical correlation which aims to more accurately predict the thermal protection system mass fraction for high heat load conditions during entry and aerocapture at Uranus and Neptune.

                  When it comes to in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the controller area network -- CAN -- bus dominates the market; automobiles manufactured and sold around the world depend on the CAN bus for safety-critical communications between various components of the vehicle (e.g., the engine, the transmission, the steering column). Unfortunately, the CAN bus is inherently insecure; in fact, it completely lacks controls such as authentication, authorization, and confidentiality (i.e., encryption). Therefore, researchers have travailed to develop automotive security enhancements. The automotive intrusion detection system (IDS) is especially popular in the literature -- due to its relatively low cost in terms of money, resource utilization, and implementation effort. That said, developing and evaluating an automotive IDS is often challenging; if researchers do not have access to a test vehicle, then they are forced to depend on publicly available CAN data -- which is not without limitations. Lack of access to adequate CAN data, then, becomes a barrier to entry into automotive security research.   We seek to lower that barrier to entry by introducing a new CAN dataset to facilitate the development and evaluation of automotive IDSs. Our dataset, dubbed can-train-and-test, provides CAN data from four different vehicles produced by two different manufacturers. The attack captures for each vehicle model are equivalent, enabling researchers to assess the ability of a given IDS to generalize to different vehicle models and even different vehicle manufacturers. Our dataset contains replayable .log files as well as labeled and unlabeled .csv files, thereby meeting a variety of development and evaluation needs. Furthermore, can-train-and-test offers nine unique attacks, ranging from denial of service (DoS) to gear spoofing to standstill...

                  Supervised 3D Object Detection models have been displaying increasingly better performance in single-domain cases where the training data comes from the same environment and sensor as the testing data. However, in real-world scenarios data from the target domain may not be available for finetuning or for domain adaptation methods. Indeed, 3D object detection models trained on a source dataset with a specific point distribution have shown difficulties in generalizing to unseen datasets. Therefore, we decided to leverage the information available from several annotated source datasets with our Multi-Dataset Training for 3D Object Detection (MDT3D) method to increase the robustness of 3D object detection models when tested in a new environment with a different sensor configuration. To tackle the labelling gap between datasets, we used a new label mapping based on coarse labels. Furthermore, we show how we managed the mix of datasets during training and finally introduce a new cross-dataset augmentation method: cross-dataset object injection. We demonstrate that this training paradigm shows improvements for different types of 3D object detection models. The source code and additional results for this research project will be publicly available on GitHub for interested parties to access and utilize: https://github.com/LouisSF/MDT3D

                  As the complexity of robot systems increases, it becomes more effective to simulate them before deployment. To do this, a model of the robot's kinematics or dynamics is required, and the most commonly used format is the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). This article presents, to our knowledge, the first dataset of URDF files from various industrial and research organizations, with metadata describing each robot, its type, manufacturer, and the source of the model. The dataset contains 322 URDF files of which 195 are unique robot models, meaning the excess URDFs are either of a robot that is multiply defined across sources or URDF variants of the same robot. We analyze the files in the dataset, where we, among other things, provide information on how they were generated, which mesh file types are most commonly used, and compare models of multiply defined robots. The intention of this article is to build a foundation of knowledge on URDF and how it is used based on publicly available URDF files. Publishing the dataset, analysis, and the scripts and tools used enables others using, researching or developing URDFs to easily access this data and use it in their own work.

                  In the field of phase change phenomena, the lack of accessible and diverse datasets suitable for machine learning (ML) training poses a significant challenge. Existing experimental datasets are often restricted, with limited availability and sparse ground truth data, impeding our understanding of this complex multi-physics phenomena. To bridge this gap, we present the BubbleML Dataset(https://github.com/HPCForge/BubbleML) which leverages physics-driven simulations to provide accurate ground truth information for various boiling scenarios, encompassing nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled boiling. This extensive dataset covers a wide range of parameters, including varying gravity conditions, flow rates, sub-cooling levels, and wall superheat, comprising 51 simulations. BubbleML is validated against experimental observations and trends, establishing it as an invaluable resource for ML research. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to facilitate exploration of diverse downstream tasks by introducing two benchmarks: (a) optical flow analysis to capture bubble dynamics, and (b) operator networks for learning temperature dynamics. The BubbleML dataset and its benchmarks serve as a catalyst for advancements in ML-driven research on multi-physics phase change phenomena, enabling the development and comparison of state-of-the-art techniques and models.

                  There is a growing interest in device-control systems that can interpret human natural language instructions and execute them on a digital device by directly controlling its user interface. We present a dataset for device-control research, Android in the Wild (AITW), which is orders of magnitude larger than current datasets. The dataset contains human demonstrations of device interactions, including the screens and actions, and corresponding natural language instructions. It consists of 715k episodes spanning 30k unique instructions, four versions of Android (v10-13),and eight device types (Pixel 2 XL to Pixel 6) with varying screen resolutions. It contains multi-step tasks that require semantic understanding of language and visual context. This dataset poses a new challenge: actions available through the user interface must be inferred from their visual appearance. And, instead of simple UI element-based actions, the action space consists of precise gestures (e.g., horizontal scrolls to operate carousel widgets). We organize our dataset to encourage robustness analysis of device-control systems, i.e., how well a system performs in the presence of new task descriptions, new applications, or new platform versions. We develop two agents and report performance across the dataset. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/android_in_the_wild.

                  Dataset Condensation aims to condense a large dataset into a smaller one while maintaining its ability to train a well-performing model, thus reducing the storage cost and training effort in deep learning applications. However, conventional dataset condensation methods are optimization-oriented and condense the dataset by performing gradient or parameter matching during model optimization, which is computationally intensive even on small datasets and models. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset condensation method based on distribution matching, which is more efficient and promising. Specifically, we identify two important shortcomings of naive distribution matching (i.e., imbalanced feature numbers and unvalidated embeddings for distance computation) and address them with three novel techniques (i.e., partitioning and expansion augmentation, efficient and enriched model sampling, and class-aware distribution regularization). Our simple yet effective method outperforms most previous optimization-oriented methods with much fewer computational resources, thereby scaling data condensation to larger datasets and models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are available at https://github.com/uitrbn/IDM

                  Automatic tree density estimation and counting using single aerial and satellite images is a challenging task in photogrammetry and remote sensing, yet has an important role in forest management. In this paper, we propose the first semisupervised transformer-based framework for tree counting which reduces the expensive tree annotations for remote sensing images. Our method, termed as TreeFormer, first develops a pyramid tree representation module based on transformer blocks to extract multi-scale features during the encoding stage. Contextual attention-based feature fusion and tree density regressor modules are further designed to utilize the robust features from the encoder to estimate tree density maps in the decoder. Moreover, we propose a pyramid learning strategy that includes local tree density consistency and local tree count ranking losses to utilize unlabeled images into the training process. Finally, the tree counter token is introduced to regulate the network by computing the global tree counts for both labeled and unlabeled images. Our model was evaluated on two benchmark tree counting datasets, Jiangsu, and Yosemite, as well as a new dataset, KCL-London, created by ourselves. Our TreeFormer outperforms the state of the art semi-supervised methods under the same setting and exceeds the fully-supervised methods using the same number of labeled images. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/HAAClassic/TreeFormer.

                  Visual anomaly detection is essential and commonly used for many tasks in the field of computer vision. Recent anomaly detection datasets mainly focus on industrial automated inspection, medical image analysis and video surveillance. In order to broaden the application and research of anomaly detection in unmanned supermarkets and smart manufacturing, we introduce the supermarket goods anomaly detection (GoodsAD) dataset. It contains 6124 high-resolution images of 484 different appearance goods divided into 6 categories. Each category contains several common different types of anomalies such as deformation, surface damage and opened. Anomalies contain both texture changes and structural changes. It follows the unsupervised setting and only normal (defect-free) images are used for training. Pixel-precise ground truth regions are provided for all anomalies. Moreover, we also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. This initial benchmark indicates that some methods which perform well on the industrial anomaly detection dataset (e.g., MVTec AD), show poor performance on our dataset. This is a comprehensive, multi-object dataset for supermarket goods anomaly detection that focuses on real-world applications.

                  We show, for the first time, that neural networks trained only on synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the problem of 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation from real images. Previous synthetic datasets have been small, unrealistic, or lacked realistic clothing. Achieving sufficient realism is non-trivial and we show how to do this for full bodies in motion. Specifically, our BEDLAM dataset contains monocular RGB videos with ground-truth 3D bodies in SMPL-X format. It includes a diversity of body shapes, motions, skin tones, hair, and clothing. The clothing is realistically simulated on the moving bodies using commercial clothing physics simulation. We render varying numbers of people in realistic scenes with varied lighting and camera motions. We then train various HPS regressors using BEDLAM and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on real-image benchmarks despite training with synthetic data. We use BEDLAM to gain insights into what model design choices are important for accuracy. With good synthetic training data, we find that a basic method like HMR approaches the accuracy of the current SOTA method (CLIFF). BEDLAM is useful for a variety of tasks and all images, ground truth bodies, 3D clothing, support code, and more are available for research purposes. Additionally, we provide detailed information about our synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling others to generate their own datasets. See the project page: https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de/.

                  With the increasing adoption of robots across industries, it is crucial to focus on developing advanced algorithms that enable robots to anticipate, comprehend, and plan their actions effectively in collaboration with humans. We introduce the Robot Autonomous Motion (RoAM) video dataset, which is collected with a custom-made turtlebot3 Burger robot in a variety of indoor environments recording various human motions from the robot's ego-vision. The dataset also includes synchronized records of the LiDAR scan and all control actions taken by the robot as it navigates around static and moving human agents. The unique dataset provides an opportunity to develop and benchmark new visual prediction frameworks that can predict future image frames based on the action taken by the recording agent in partially observable scenarios or cases where the imaging sensor is mounted on a moving platform. We have benchmarked the dataset on our novel deep visual prediction framework called ACPNet where the approximated future image frames are also conditioned on action taken by the robot and demonstrated its potential for incorporating robot dynamics into the video prediction paradigm for mobile robotics and autonomous navigation research.

                  Mentions of new concepts appear regularly in texts and require automated approaches to harvest and place them into Knowledge Bases (KB), e.g., ontologies and taxonomies. Existing datasets suffer from three issues, (i) mostly assuming that a new concept is pre-discovered and cannot support out-of-KB mention discovery; (ii) only using the concept label as the input along with the KB and thus lacking the contexts of a concept label; and (iii) mostly focusing on concept placement w.r.t a taxonomy of atomic concepts, instead of complex concepts, i.e., with logical operators. To address these issues, we propose a new benchmark, adapting MedMentions dataset (PubMed abstracts) with SNOMED CT versions in 2014 and 2017 under the Diseases sub-category and the broader categories of Clinical finding, Procedure, and Pharmaceutical / biologic product. We provide usage on the evaluation with the dataset for out-of-KB mention discovery and concept placement, adapting recent Large Language Model based methods.

                  We conduct the first empirical study on using knowledge transfer to improve the generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks, which often require LLMs to generalize beyond their training data. Our proposed general knowledge transfer approach guides the LLM towards a similar and familiar API or code snippet it has encountered before, improving the model's generalization ability for unseen knowledge. We apply this approach to three software engineering tasks: API inference, code example generation, and FQN inference, and find transfer span, transfer strategy, and transfer architecture as key factors affecting the method. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of knowledge transfer and its potential to enhance LLMs' performance in various software engineering tasks. The effectiveness of knowledge transfer varies depending on the target domain and task, with the hierarchical strategy being more effective than direct transfer, and AI-Chain outperforming CoT in prompt design. The implications of these findings extend beyond software engineering tasks and suggest that knowledge transfer can enhance LLMs' ability to handle unknowns in any natural language task.

                  This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified. A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly evolving field of content generation.

                  The recently released ChatGPT model demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in zero-shot question-answering. In this work, we probe ChatGPT for its conversational understanding and introduce a conversational framework (protocol) that can be adopted in future studies. The Pok\'emon universe serves as an ideal testing ground for auditing ChatGPT's reasoning capabilities due to its closed world assumption. After bringing ChatGPT's background knowledge (on the Pok\'emon universe) to light, we test its reasoning process when using these concepts in battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability to acquire new knowledge and include it in its reasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to assess ChatGPT's ability to generalize, combine features, and to acquire and reason over newly introduced knowledge from human feedback. We find that ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe, which can reason upon in battle scenarios to a great extent, even when new information is introduced. The model performs better with collaborative feedback and if there is an initial phase of information retrieval, but also hallucinates occasionally and is susceptible to adversarial attacks.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.

                  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its effectiveness in segmenting any object/part in various 2D images, yet its ability for 3D has not been fully explored. The real world is composed of numerous 3D scenes and objects. Due to the scarcity of accessible 3D data and high cost of its acquisition and annotation, lifting SAM to 3D is a challenging but valuable research avenue. With this in mind, we propose a novel framework to Segment Anything in 3D, named SA3D. Given a neural radiance field (NeRF) model, SA3D allows users to obtain the 3D segmentation result of any target object via only one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view. With input prompts, SAM cuts out the target object from the according view. The obtained 2D segmentation mask is projected onto 3D mask grids via density-guided inverse rendering. 2D masks from other views are then rendered, which are mostly uncompleted but used as cross-view self-prompts to be fed into SAM again. Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning. The entire segmentation process can be completed in approximately two minutes without any engineering optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SA3D in different scenes, highlighting the potential of SAM in 3D scene perception. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                Large Language Models in the Workplace: A Case Study on Prompt Engineering for Job Type Classification

                  This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.

                  Extraction of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their semantic relations from unstructured text (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a fundamental work for software engineering tasks (e.g., API recommendation). However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning.

                  Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., "open door" and "open fridge", "walk upstairs" and "walk downstairs". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens ("open", "walk"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution ("open fridge", "walk upstairs") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.
