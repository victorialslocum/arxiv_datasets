                  Adverse conditions typically suffer from stochastic hybrid weather degradations (e.g., rainy and hazy night), while existing image restoration algorithms envisage that weather degradations occur independently, thus may fail to handle real-world complicated scenarios. Besides, supervised training is not feasible due to the lack of comprehensive paired dataset to characterize hybrid conditions. To this end, we have advanced the forementioned limitations with two tactics: framework and data. On the one hand, we present a novel unified framework, dubbed RAHC, to Restore Arbitrary Hybrid adverse weather Conditions in one go, which can comfortably cope with hybrid scenarios with insufficient remaining background constituents and restore arbitrary hybrid conditions with a single trained model flexibly. On the other hand, we establish a new dataset, termed HAC, for learning and benchmarking arbitrary Hybrid Adverse Conditions restoration. HAC contains 31 scenarios composed of an arbitrary combination of five common weather, with a total of ~316K adverse-weather/clean pairs. As for fabrication, the training set is automatically generated by a dedicated AdverseGAN with no-frills labor, while the test set is manually modulated by experts for authoritative evaluation. Extensive experiments yield superior results and in particular establish new state-of-the-art results on both HAC and conventional datasets.

                  We propose a method that augments a simulated dataset using diffusion models to improve the performance of pedestrian detection in real-world data. The high cost of collecting and annotating data in the real-world has motivated the use of simulation platforms to create training datasets. While simulated data is inexpensive to collect and annotate, it unfortunately does not always closely match the distribution of real-world data, which is known as the sim2real gap. In this paper we propose a novel method of synthetic data creation meant to close the sim2real gap for the challenging pedestrian detection task. Our method uses a diffusion-based architecture to learn a real-world distribution which, once trained, is used to generate datasets. We mix this generated data with simulated data as a form of augmentation and show that training on a combination of generated and simulated data increases average precision by as much as 27.3% for pedestrian detection models in real-world data, compared against training on purely simulated data.

                  Porting a scientific data analysis workflow (DAW) to a cluster infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general, non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and time-consuming.   We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying some logical conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability, adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit. Once specified, VC can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure, and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behaviour (e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a first sketch for VCs' implementation into existing DAW infrastructures.

                  Many complex systems often contain interactions between more than two nodes, known as higher-order interactions, which can change the structure of these systems in significant ways. Researchers often assume that all interactions paint a consistent picture of a higher-order dataset's structure. In contrast, the connection patterns of individuals or entities in empirical systems are often stratified by interaction size. Ignoring this fact can aggregate connection patterns that exist only at certain scales of interaction. To isolate these scale-dependent patterns, we present an approach for analyzing higher-order datasets by filtering interactions by their size. We apply this framework to several empirical datasets from three domains to demonstrate that data practitioners can gain valuable information from this approach.

                Spectral Clustering on Large Datasets: When Does it Work? Theory from Continuous Clustering and Density Cheeger-Buser

                  Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms that has stood the test of time. It is simple to describe, can be implemented using standard linear algebra, and often finds better clusters than traditional clustering algorithms like $k$-means and $k$-centers. The foundational algorithm for two-way spectral clustering, by Shi and Malik, creates a geometric graph from data and finds a spectral cut of the graph.   In modern machine learning, many data sets are modeled as a large number of points drawn from a probability density function. Little is known about when spectral clustering works in this setting -- and when it doesn't. Past researchers justified spectral clustering by appealing to the graph Cheeger inequality (which states that the spectral cut of a graph approximates the ``Normalized Cut''), but this justification is known to break down on large data sets.   We provide theoretically-informed intuition about spectral clustering on large data sets drawn from probability densities, by proving when a continuous form of spectral clustering considered by past researchers (the unweighted spectral cut of a probability density) finds good clusters of the underlying density itself. Our work suggests that Shi-Malik spectral clustering works well on data drawn from mixtures of Laplace distributions, and works poorly on data drawn from certain other densities, such as a density we call the `square-root trough'.   Our core theorem proves that weighted spectral cuts have low weighted isoperimetry for all probability densities. Our key tool is a new Cheeger-Buser inequality for all probability densities, including discontinuous ones.

                  Compared to news and chat summarization, the development of meeting summarization is hugely decelerated by the limited data. To this end, we introduce a versatile Chinese meeting summarization dataset, dubbed VCSum, consisting of 239 real-life meetings, with a total duration of over 230 hours. We claim our dataset is versatile because we provide the annotations of topic segmentation, headlines, segmentation summaries, overall meeting summaries, and salient sentences for each meeting transcript. As such, the dataset can adapt to various summarization tasks or methods, including segmentation-based summarization, multi-granularity summarization and retrieval-then-generate summarization. Our analysis confirms the effectiveness and robustness of VCSum. We also provide a set of benchmark models regarding different downstream summarization tasks on VCSum to facilitate further research. The dataset and code will be released at \url{https://github.com/hahahawu/VCSum}.

                  Emergent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities promise to improve performance and explainability of large language models (LLMs). However, uncertainties remain about how prompting strategies formulated for previous model generations generalize to new model generations and different datasets. In this small-scale study we compare the performance of a range of zero-shot prompts for inducing CoT reasoning across six recently released LLMs (davinci-002, davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5-xxl and Cohere command-xlarge) on a mixture of six question-answering datasets, including datasets from scientific and medical domains. We find that a CoT prompt that was previously discovered through automated prompt discovery shows robust performance across experimental conditions and produces best results when applied to the state-of-the-art model GPT-4.

                  Video super-resolution (VSR) techniques, especially deep-learning-based algorithms, have drastically improved over the last few years and shown impressive performance on synthetic data. However, their performance on real-world video data suffers because of the complexity of real-world degradations and misaligned video frames. Since obtaining a synthetic dataset consisting of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) frames are easier than obtaining real-world LR and HR images, in this paper, we propose synthesizing real-world degradations on synthetic training datasets. The proposed synthetic real-world degradations (SRWD) include a combination of the blur, noise, downsampling, pixel binning, and image and video compression artifacts. We then propose using a random shuffling-based strategy to simulate these degradations on the training datasets and train a single end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) on the proposed larger variation of realistic synthesized training data. Our quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis shows that the proposed training strategy using diverse realistic degradations improves the performance by 7.1 % in terms of NRQM compared to RealBasicVSR and by 3.34 % compared to BSRGAN on the VideoLQ dataset. We also introduce a new dataset that contains high-resolution real-world videos that can serve as a common ground for bench-marking.

                  In recent years, raw video denoising has garnered increased attention due to the consistency with the imaging process and well-studied noise modeling in the raw domain. However, two problems still hinder the denoising performance. Firstly, there is no large dataset with realistic motions for supervised raw video denoising, as capturing noisy and clean frames for real dynamic scenes is difficult. To address this, we propose recapturing existing high-resolution videos displayed on a 4K screen with high-low ISO settings to construct noisy-clean paired frames. In this way, we construct a video denoising dataset (named as ReCRVD) with 120 groups of noisy-clean videos, whose ISO values ranging from 1600 to 25600. Secondly, while non-local temporal-spatial attention is beneficial for denoising, it often leads to heavy computation costs. We propose an efficient raw video denoising transformer network (RViDeformer) that explores both short and long-distance correlations. Specifically, we propose multi-branch spatial and temporal attention modules, which explore the patch correlations from local window, local low-resolution window, global downsampled window, and neighbor-involved window, and then they are fused together. We employ reparameterization to reduce computation costs. Our network is trained in both supervised and unsupervised manners, achieving the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the model trained with our proposed dataset (ReCRVD) outperforms the model trained with previous benchmark dataset (CRVD) when evaluated on the real-world outdoor noisy videos. Our code and dataset will be released after the acceptance of this work.

                  In the field of computer- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enormous progress has been made in recent years based on the recognition of surgical instruments in endoscopic images. Especially the determination of the position and type of the instruments is of great interest here. Current work involves both spatial and temporal information with the idea, that the prediction of movement of surgical tools over time may improve the quality of final segmentations. The provision of publicly available datasets has recently encouraged the development of new methods, mainly based on deep learning. In this review, we identify datasets used for method development and evaluation, as well as quantify their frequency of use in the literature. We further present an overview of the current state of research regarding the segmentation and tracking of minimally invasive surgical instruments in endoscopic images. The paper focuses on methods that work purely visually without attached markers of any kind on the instruments, taking into account both single-frame segmentation approaches as well as those involving temporal information. A discussion of the reviewed literature is provided, highlighting existing shortcomings and emphasizing available potential for future developments. The publications considered were identified through the platforms Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed. The search terms used were "instrument segmentation", "instrument tracking", "surgical tool segmentation", and "surgical tool tracking" and result in 408 articles published between 2015 and 2022 from which 109 were included using systematic selection criteria.

                  Lifelogging has gained more attention due to its wide applications, such as personalized recommendations or memory assistance. The issues of collecting and extracting personal life events have emerged. People often share their life experiences with others through conversations. However, extracting life events from conversations is rarely explored. In this paper, we present Life Event Dialog, a dataset containing fine-grained life event annotations on conversational data. In addition, we initiate a novel conversational life event extraction task and differentiate the task from the public event extraction or the life event extraction from other sources like microblogs. We explore three information extraction (IE) frameworks to address the conversational life event extraction task: OpenIE, relation extraction, and event extraction. A comprehensive empirical analysis of the three baselines is established. The results suggest that the current event extraction model still struggles with extracting life events from human daily conversations. Our proposed life event dialog dataset and in-depth analysis of IE frameworks will facilitate future research on life event extraction from conversations.

                  Human pose estimation (HPE) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for indoor monitoring is one of the major challenges in computer vision. In contrast to HPE in perspective views, an indoor monitoring system can consist of an omnidirectional camera with a field of view of 180{\deg} to detect the pose of a person with only one sensor per room. To recognize human pose, the detection of keypoints is an essential upstream step. In our work we propose a new dataset for training and evaluation of CNNs for the task of keypoint detection in omnidirectional images. The training dataset, THEODORE+, consists of 50,000 images and is created by a 3D rendering engine, where humans are randomly walking through an indoor environment. In a dynamically created 3D scene, persons move randomly with simultaneously moving omnidirectional camera to generate synthetic RGB images and 2D and 3D ground truth. For evaluation purposes, the real-world PoseFES dataset with two scenarios and 701 frames with up to eight persons per scene was captured and annotated. We propose four training paradigms to finetune or re-train two top-down models in MMPose and two bottom-up models in CenterNet on THEODORE+. Beside a qualitative evaluation we report quantitative results. Compared to a COCO pretrained baseline, we achieve significant improvements especially for top-view scenes on the PoseFES dataset.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.

                  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its effectiveness in segmenting any object/part in various 2D images, yet its ability for 3D has not been fully explored. The real world is composed of numerous 3D scenes and objects. Due to the scarcity of accessible 3D data and high cost of its acquisition and annotation, lifting SAM to 3D is a challenging but valuable research avenue. With this in mind, we propose a novel framework to Segment Anything in 3D, named SA3D. Given a neural radiance field (NeRF) model, SA3D allows users to obtain the 3D segmentation result of any target object via only one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view. With input prompts, SAM cuts out the target object from the according view. The obtained 2D segmentation mask is projected onto 3D mask grids via density-guided inverse rendering. 2D masks from other views are then rendered, which are mostly uncompleted but used as cross-view self-prompts to be fed into SAM again. Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning. The entire segmentation process can be completed in approximately two minutes without any engineering optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SA3D in different scenes, highlighting the potential of SAM in 3D scene perception. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/.

                  In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a novel method for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and answer genomics questions. Specifically, we prompt Codex (code-davinci-002) to solve the GeneTuring tests with few-shot URL requests of NCBI API calls as demonstrations for in-context learning. During inference, we stop the decoding once a call request is detected and make the API call with the generated URL. We then append the raw execution results returned by NCBI APIs to the generated texts and continue the generation until the answer is found or another API call is detected. Our preliminary results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on three out of four one-shot tasks and four out of five zero-shot tasks in the GeneTuring dataset. Overall, GeneGPT achieves a macro-average score of 0.76, which is much higher than retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the New Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as other LLMs such as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12).

                  An open source software package for simulating thermal neutron propagation in geometry is presented. In this system, neutron propagation can be treated by either the particle transport method or the ray-tracing method. Supported by an accurate backend scattering physics engine, this system is capable of reproducing neutron scattering experiments in complex geometries and is expected to be used in the areas of instrument characterisation, optimisation and data analysis.   In this paper, the relevant theories are briefly introduced. The simulation flow and the user input syntax to control it are provided in detail. Five benchmarking simulations, focusing on different aspects of simulation and scattering techniques, are given to demonstrate the applications of this simulation system. They include an idealised total scattering instrument, a monochromatic powder diffractometer, a neutron guide, a chopper and an imaging setup for complex geometries. Simulated results are benchmarked against experimental data or well-established software packages when appropriate. Good agreements are observed.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                  The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly conversational LLMs like ChatGPT, have prompted changes in a range of fields, including design. This study aims to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in a human-centered design process. To this end, a hypothetical design project was conducted, where ChatGPT was utilized to generate personas, simulate interviews with fictional users, create new design ideas, simulate usage scenarios and conversations between an imaginary prototype and fictional users, and lastly evaluate user experience. The results show that ChatGPT effectively performed the tasks assigned to it as a designer, user, or product, providing mostly appropriate responses. The study does, however, highlight some drawbacks such as forgotten information, partial responses, and a lack of output diversity. The paper explains the potential benefits and limitations of using conversational LLMs in design, discusses its implications, and suggests directions for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

                  Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.

                  Explaining the black-box predictions of NLP models naturally and accurately is an important open problem in natural language generation. These free-text explanations are expected to contain sufficient and carefully-selected evidence to form supportive arguments for predictions. Due to the superior generative capacity of large pretrained language models, recent work built on prompt engineering enables explanation generation without specific training. However, explanation generated through single-pass prompting often lacks sufficiency and conciseness. To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise. Our approach regenerates the free-text explanation by polishing the single-pass output from the pretrained language model but retaining the information that supports the contents being explained. Experiments on two out-of-domain tasks verify the effectiveness of EIB through automatic evaluation and thoroughly-conducted human evaluation.

                  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

                  We present a multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A within the internal shock scenario. We consider the time-dependent evolution of the outflow with its impact on the observed light curve from multiple collisions, and the self-consistent generation of the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\sim1$~s. We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum. Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.
