                  This paper seeks to solve Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which aims to mitigate data distribution shifts when transferring knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. We propose a novel MSDA framework based on dictionary learning and optimal transport. We interpret each domain in MSDA as an empirical distribution. As such, we express each domain as a Wasserstein barycenter of dictionary atoms, which are empirical distributions. We propose a novel algorithm, DaDiL, for learning via mini-batches: (i) atom distributions; (ii) a matrix of barycentric coordinates. Based on our dictionary, we propose two novel methods for MSDA: DaDil-R, based on the reconstruction of labeled samples in the target domain, and DaDiL-E, based on the ensembling of classifiers learned on atom distributions. We evaluate our methods in 3 benchmarks: Caltech-Office, Office 31, and CRWU, where we improved previous state-of-the-art by 3.15%, 2.29%, and 7.71% in classification performance. Finally, we show that interpolations in the Wasserstein hull of learned atoms provide data that can generalize to the target domain.

                  We present a new large-scale emotion-labeled symbolic music dataset consisting of 12k MIDI songs. To create this dataset, we first trained emotion classification models on the GoEmotions dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with a model half the size of the baseline. We then applied these models to lyrics from two large-scale MIDI datasets. Our dataset covers a wide range of fine-grained emotions, providing a valuable resource to explore the connection between music and emotions and, especially, to develop models that can generate music based on specific emotions. Our code for inference, trained models, and datasets are available online.

                  Individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are crucial for accurate sound positioning in virtual auditory displays. As the acoustic measurement of HRTFs is resource-intensive, predicting individualized HRTFs using machine learning models is a promising approach at scale. Training such models require a unified HRTF representation across multiple databases to utilize their respectively limited samples. However, in addition to differences on the spatial sampling locations, recent studies have shown that, even for the common location, HRTFs across databases manifest consistent differences that make it trivial to tell which databases they come from. This poses a significant challenge for learning a unified HRTF representation across databases. In this work, we first identify the possible causes of these cross-database differences, attributing them to variations in the measurement setup. Then, we propose a novel approach to normalize the frequency responses of HRTFs across databases. We show that HRTFs from different databases cannot be classified by their database after normalization. We further show that these normalized HRTFs can be used to learn a more unified HRTF representation across databases than the prior art. We believe that this normalization approach paves the road to many data-intensive tasks on HRTF modeling.

                  Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays an indispensable role in monitoring and improving the end-users' viewing experience in various real-world video-enabled media applications. As an experimental field, the improvements of BVQA models have been measured primarily on a few human-rated VQA datasets. Thus, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of existing VQA datasets in order to properly evaluate the current progress in BVQA. Towards this goal, we conduct a first-of-its-kind computational analysis of VQA datasets via designing minimalistic BVQA models. By minimalistic, we restrict our family of BVQA models to build only upon basic blocks: a video preprocessor (for aggressive spatiotemporal downsampling), a spatial quality analyzer, an optional temporal quality analyzer, and a quality regressor, all with the simplest possible instantiations. By comparing the quality prediction performance of different model variants on eight VQA datasets with realistic distortions, we find that nearly all datasets suffer from the easy dataset problem of varying severity, some of which even admit blind image quality assessment (BIQA) solutions. We additionally justify our claims by contrasting our model generalizability on these VQA datasets, and by ablating a dizzying set of BVQA design choices related to the basic building blocks. Our results cast doubt on the current progress in BVQA, and meanwhile shed light on good practices of constructing next-generation VQA datasets and models.

                  The field of trajectory forecasting has grown significantly in recent years, partially owing to the release of numerous large-scale, real-world human trajectory datasets for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrian motion tracking. While such datasets have been a boon for the community, they each use custom and unique data formats and APIs, making it cumbersome for researchers to train and evaluate methods across multiple datasets. To remedy this, we present trajdata: a unified interface to multiple human trajectory datasets. At its core, trajdata provides a simple, uniform, and efficient representation and API for trajectory and map data. As a demonstration of its capabilities, in this work we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing trajectory datasets, providing users with a rich understanding of the data underpinning much of current pedestrian and AV motion forecasting research, and proposing suggestions for future datasets from these insights. trajdata is permissively licensed (Apache 2.0) and can be accessed online at https://github.com/NVlabs/trajdata

                  Android app developers extensively employ code reuse, integrating many third-party libraries into their apps. While such integration is practical for developers, it can be challenging for static analyzers to achieve scalability and precision when such libraries can account for a large part of the app code. As a direct consequence, when a static analysis is performed, it is common practice in the literature to only consider developer code --with the assumption that the sought issues are in developer code rather than in the libraries. However, analysts need to precisely distinguish between library code and developer code in Android apps to ensure the effectiveness of static analysis. Currently, many static analysis approaches rely on white lists of libraries. However, these white lists are unreliable, as they are inaccurate and largely non-comprehensive.   In this paper, we propose a new approach to address the lack of comprehensive and automated solutions for the production of accurate and "always up to date" sets of third-party libraries. First, we demonstrate the continued need for a white list of third-party libraries. Second, we propose an automated approach to produce an accurate and up-to-date set of third-party libraries in the form of a dataset called AndroLibZoo. Our dataset, which we make available to the research community, contains to date 20 162 libraries and is meant to evolve. Third, we illustrate the significance of using AndroLibZoo to filter libraries in recent apps. Fourth, we demonstrate that AndroLibZoo is more suitable than the current state-of-the-art list for improved static analysis. Finally, we show how the use of AndroLibZoo can enhance the performance of existing Android app static analyzers.

                  The widespread use of face retouching filters on short-video platforms has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital appearances and the impact of deceptive advertising. To address these issues, there is a pressing need to develop advanced face retouching techniques. However, the lack of large-scale and fine-grained face retouching datasets has been a major obstacle to progress in this field. In this paper, we introduce RetouchingFFHQ, a large-scale and fine-grained face retouching dataset that contains over half a million conditionally-retouched images. RetouchingFFHQ stands out from previous datasets due to its large scale, high quality, fine-grainedness, and customization. By including four typical types of face retouching operations and different retouching levels, we extend the binary face retouching detection into a fine-grained, multi-retouching type, and multi-retouching level estimation problem. Additionally, we propose a Multi-granularity Attention Module (MAM) as a plugin for CNN backbones for enhanced cross-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments using different baselines as well as our proposed method on RetouchingFFHQ show decent performance on face retouching detection. With the proposed new dataset, we believe there is great potential for future work to tackle the challenging problem of real-world fine-grained face retouching detection.

                  I propose an open dataset of country-level historical opinion polling data for the European Union and the UK. The dataset aims to fill a gap in available opinion polling data for the European Union. Some existing datasets are restricted to the past five years, limiting research opportunities. At the same time, some larger proprietary datasets exist but are available only in a visual preprocessed time series format. Finally, while other large datasets for individual countries might exist, these could be inaccessible due to language barriers. The data was gathered from Wikipedia, and preprocessed using the pandas library. Both the raw and the preprocessed data are in the .csv format. I hope that given the recent advances in LLMs and deep learning in general, this large dataset will enable researchers to uncover complex interactions between multimodal data (news articles, economic indicators, social media) and voting behavior. The raw data, the preprocessed data, and the preprocessing scripts are available on GitHub.

                  Human Pose Estimation is a thoroughly researched problem; however, most datasets focus on the side and front-view scenarios. We address the limitation by proposing a novel approach that tackles the challenges posed by extreme viewpoints and poses. We introduce a new method for synthetic data generation - RePoGen, RarE POses GENerator - with comprehensive control over pose and view to augment the COCO dataset. Experiments on a new dataset of real images show that adding RePoGen data to the COCO surpasses previous attempts to top-view pose estimation and significantly improves performance on the bottom-view dataset. Through an extensive ablation study on both the top and bottom view data, we elucidate the contributions of methodological choices and demonstrate improved performance. The code and the datasets are available on the project website.

                  Autonomous driving on water surfaces plays an essential role in executing hazardous and time-consuming missions, such as maritime surveillance, survivors rescue, environmental monitoring, hydrography mapping and waste cleaning. This work presents WaterScenes, the first multi-task 4D radar-camera fusion dataset for autonomous driving on water surfaces. Equipped with a 4D radar and a monocular camera, our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) proffers all-weather solutions for discerning object-related information, including color, shape, texture, range, velocity, azimuth, and elevation. Focusing on typical static and dynamic objects on water surfaces, we label the camera images and radar point clouds at pixel-level and point-level, respectively. In addition to basic perception tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, we also provide annotations for free-space segmentation and waterline segmentation. Leveraging the multi-task and multi-modal data, we conduct numerous experiments on the single modality of radar and camera, as well as the fused modalities. Results demonstrate that 4D radar-camera fusion can considerably enhance the robustness of perception on water surfaces, especially in adverse lighting and weather conditions. WaterScenes dataset is public on https://waterscenes.github.io.

                  Automatic tree density estimation and counting using single aerial and satellite images is a challenging task in photogrammetry and remote sensing, yet has an important role in forest management. In this paper, we propose the first semisupervised transformer-based framework for tree counting which reduces the expensive tree annotations for remote sensing images. Our method, termed as TreeFormer, first develops a pyramid tree representation module based on transformer blocks to extract multi-scale features during the encoding stage. Contextual attention-based feature fusion and tree density regressor modules are further designed to utilize the robust features from the encoder to estimate tree density maps in the decoder. Moreover, we propose a pyramid learning strategy that includes local tree density consistency and local tree count ranking losses to utilize unlabeled images into the training process. Finally, the tree counter token is introduced to regulate the network by computing the global tree counts for both labeled and unlabeled images. Our model was evaluated on two benchmark tree counting datasets, Jiangsu, and Yosemite, as well as a new dataset, KCL-London, created by ourselves. Our TreeFormer outperforms the state of the art semi-supervised methods under the same setting and exceeds the fully-supervised methods using the same number of labeled images. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/HAAClassic/TreeFormer.

                  Different distribution shifts require different algorithmic and operational interventions. Methodological research must be grounded by the specific shifts they address. Although nascent benchmarks provide a promising empirical foundation, they implicitly focus on covariate shifts, and the validity of empirical findings depends on the type of shift, e.g., previous observations on algorithmic performance can fail to be valid when the $Y|X$ distribution changes. We conduct a thorough investigation of natural shifts in 5 tabular datasets over 86,000 model configurations, and find that $Y|X$-shifts are most prevalent. To encourage researchers to develop a refined language for distribution shifts, we build WhyShift, an empirical testbed of curated real-world shifts where we characterize the type of shift we benchmark performance over. Since $Y|X$-shifts are prevalent in tabular settings, we identify covariate regions that suffer the biggest $Y|X$-shifts and discuss implications for algorithmic and data-based interventions. Our testbed highlights the importance of future research that builds an understanding of how distributions differ.

                  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a proven approach to secure networks. However, in a privately used network, it is difficult for users without cybersecurity expertise to understand IDS alerts, and to respond in time with adequate measures. This puts the security of home networks, smart home installations, home-office workers, etc. at risk, even if an IDS is correctly installed and configured. In this work, we propose ChatIDS, our approach to explain IDS alerts to non-experts by using large language models. We evaluate the feasibility of ChatIDS by using ChatGPT, and we identify open research issues with the help of interdisciplinary experts in artificial intelligence. Our results show that ChatIDS has the potential to increase network security by proposing meaningful security measures in an intuitive language from IDS alerts. Nevertheless, some potential issues in areas such as trust, privacy, ethics, etc. need to be resolved, before ChatIDS might be put into practice.

                  Existing text summarization systems have made significant progress in recent years but typically generates summaries in a single step. The one-shot summarization setting is sometimes inadequate, however, as the generated summary may contain hallucinations or overlook important details related to the reader's interests. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing SummIt, an iterative text summarization framework based on large language models like ChatGPT. Our framework enables the model to refine the generated summary iteratively through self-evaluation and feedback, closely resembling the iterative process humans undertake when drafting and revising summaries. We also explore using in-context learning to guide the rationale generation and summary refinement. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating knowledge and topic extractors into the framework to enhance summary faithfulness and controllability. We evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark summarization datasets through empirical and qualitative analyses. We also conduct a human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the model's refinements and find a potential issue of over-correction.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages on LLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how should we mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x ChrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate the importance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as the superiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.

                  In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a novel method for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and answer genomics questions. Specifically, we prompt Codex (code-davinci-002) to solve the GeneTuring tests with few-shot URL requests of NCBI API calls as demonstrations for in-context learning. During inference, we stop the decoding once a call request is detected and make the API call with the generated URL. We then append the raw execution results returned by NCBI APIs to the generated texts and continue the generation until the answer is found or another API call is detected. Our preliminary results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on three out of four one-shot tasks and four out of five zero-shot tasks in the GeneTuring dataset. Overall, GeneGPT achieves a macro-average score of 0.76, which is much higher than retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the New Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as other LLMs such as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12).

                  Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

                LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models

                  The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.
