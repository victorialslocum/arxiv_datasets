                  While recently developed NLP explainability methods let us open the black box in various ways (Madsen et al., 2022), a missing ingredient in this endeavor is an interactive tool offering a conversational interface. Such a dialogue system can help users explore datasets and models with explanations in a contextualized manner, e.g. via clarification or follow-up questions, and through a natural language interface. We adapt the conversational explanation framework TalkToModel (Slack et al., 2022) to the NLP domain, add new NLP-specific operations such as free-text rationalization, and illustrate its generalizability on three NLP tasks (dialogue act classification, question answering, hate speech detection). To recognize user queries for explanations, we evaluate fine-tuned and few-shot prompting models and implement a novel Adapter-based approach. We then conduct two user studies on (1) the perceived correctness and helpfulness of the dialogues, and (2) the simulatability, i.e. how objectively helpful dialogical explanations are for humans in figuring out the model's predicted label when it's not shown. We found rationalization and feature attribution were helpful in explaining the model behavior. Moreover, users could more reliably predict the model outcome based on an explanation dialogue rather than one-off explanations.

                  Data collection for forestry, timber, and agriculture currently relies on manual techniques which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. We seek to demonstrate that robotics offers improvements over these techniques and accelerate agricultural research, beginning with semantic segmentation and diameter estimation of trees in forests and orchards. We present TreeScope v1.0, the first robotics dataset for precision agriculture and forestry addressing the counting and mapping of trees in forestry and orchards. TreeScope provides LiDAR data from agricultural environments collected with robotics platforms, such as UAV and mobile robot platforms carried by vehicles and human operators. In the first release of this dataset, we provide ground-truth data with over 1,800 manually annotated semantic labels for tree stems and field-measured tree diameters. We share benchmark scripts for these tasks that researchers may use to evaluate the accuracy of their algorithms. Finally, we run our open-source diameter estimation and off-the-shelf semantic segmentation algorithms and share our baseline results.

                  The use of audio and visual modality for speaker localization has been well studied in the literature by exploiting their complementary characteristics. However, most previous works employ the setting of static sensors mounted at fixed positions. Unlike them, in this work, we explore the ego-centric setting, where the heterogeneous sensors are embodied and could be moving with a human to facilitate speaker localization. Compared to the static scenario, the ego-centric setting is more realistic for smart-home applications e.g., a service robot. However, this also brings new challenges such as blurred images, frequent speaker disappearance from the field of view of the wearer, and occlusions. In this paper, we study egocentric audio-visual speaker DOA estimation and deal with the challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based audio-visual fusion method to estimate the relative DOA of the speaker to the wearer, and design a training strategy to mitigate the problem of the speaker disappearing from the camera's view. We also develop a new dataset for simulating the out-of-view scenarios, by creating a scene with a camera wearer walking around while a speaker is moving at the same time. The experimental results show that our proposed method offers promising performance in this new dataset in terms of tracking accuracy. Finally, we adapt the proposed method for the multi-speaker scenario. Experiments on EasyCom show the effectiveness of the proposed model for multiple speakers in real scenarios, which achieves state-of-the-art results in the sphere active speaker detection task and the wearer activity prediction task. The simulated dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/KawhiZhao/Egocentric-Audio-Visual-Speaker-Localization.

                  In recent years, static meshes with texture maps have become one of the most prevalent digital representations of 3D shapes in various applications, such as animation, gaming, medical imaging, and cultural heritage applications. However, little research has been done on the quality assessment of textured meshes, which hinders the development of quality-oriented applications, such as mesh compression and enhancement. In this paper, we create a large-scale textured mesh quality assessment database, namely SJTU-TMQA, which includes 21 reference meshes and 945 distorted samples. The meshes are rendered into processed video sequences and then conduct subjective experiments to obtain mean opinion scores (MOS). The diversity of content and accuracy of MOS has been shown to validate its heterogeneity and reliability. The impact of various types of distortion on human perception is demonstrated. 13 state-of-the-art objective metrics are evaluated on SJTU-TMQA. The results report the highest correlation of around 0.6, indicating the need for more effective objective metrics. The SJTU-TMQA is available at https://ccccby.github.io

                  In this work we introduce the CitrusFarm dataset, a comprehensive multimodal sensory dataset collected by a wheeled mobile robot operating in agricultural fields. The dataset offers stereo RGB images with depth information, as well as monochrome, near-infrared and thermal images, presenting diverse spectral responses crucial for agricultural research. Furthermore, it provides a range of navigational sensor data encompassing wheel odometry, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GNSS with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) as the centimeter-level positioning ground truth. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected in three fields of citrus trees, featuring various tree species at different growth stages, distinctive planting patterns, as well as varying daylight conditions. It spans a total operation time of 1.7 hours, covers a distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 1.3 TB of data. We anticipate that this dataset can facilitate the development of autonomous robot systems operating in agricultural tree environments, especially for localization, mapping and crop monitoring tasks. Moreover, the rich sensing modalities offered in this dataset can also support research in a range of robotics and computer vision tasks, such as place recognition, scene understanding, object detection and segmentation, and multimodal learning. The dataset, in conjunction with related tools and resources, is made publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/Citrus-Farm-Dataset.

                  Place recognition is crucial for robotic localization and loop closure in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Recently, LiDARs have gained popularity due to their robust sensing capability and measurement consistency, even in the illumination-variant environment, offering an advantage over traditional imaging sensors. Spinning LiDARs are widely accepted among many types, while non-repetitive scanning patterns have recently been utilized in robotic applications. Beyond the range measurements, some LiDARs offer additional measurements, such as reflectivity, Near Infrared (NIR), and velocity (e.g., FMCW LiDARs). Despite these advancements, a noticeable dearth of datasets comprehensively reflects the broad spectrum of LiDAR configurations optimized for place recognition. To tackle this issue, our paper proposes the HeLiPR dataset, curated especially for place recognition with heterogeneous LiDAR systems, embodying spatial-temporal variations. To the best of our knowledge, the HeLiPR dataset is the first heterogeneous LiDAR dataset designed to support inter-LiDAR place recognition with both non-repetitive and spinning LiDARs, accommodating different field of view (FOV) and varying numbers of rays. Encompassing the distinct LiDAR configurations, it captures varied environments ranging from urban cityscapes to high-dynamic freeways over a month, designed to enhance the adaptability and robustness of place recognition across diverse scenarios. Notably, the HeLiPR dataset also includes trajectories that parallel sequences from MulRan, underscoring its utility for research in heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition and long-term studies. The dataset is accessible at https: //sites.google.com/view/heliprdataset.

                  Object-centric event data represent processes from the point of view of all the involved object types. This perspective has gained interest in recent years as it supports the analysis of processes that previously could not be adequately captured, due to the lack of a clear case notion as well as an increasing amount of output data that needs to be stored. Although publicly available event logs are crucial artifacts for researchers to develop and evaluate novel process mining techniques, the currently available object-centric event logs have limitations in this regard. Specifically, they mainly focus on control-flow and rarely contain objects with attributes that change over time, even though this is not realistic, as the attribute values of objects can be altered during their lifecycle. This paper addresses this gap by providing two means of establishing object-centric datasets with dynamically evolving attributes. First, we provide event log generators, which allow researchers to generate customized, artificial logs with dynamic attributes in the recently proposed DOCEL format. Second, we propose and evaluate an algorithm to convert OCEL logs into DOCEL logs, which involves the detection of event attributes that capture evolving object information and the creation of dynamic attributes from these. Through these contributions, this paper supports the advancement of object-centric process analysis by providing researchers with new means to obtain relevant data to use during the development of new techniques.

                  While resources for English language are fairly sufficient to understand content on social media, similar resources in Arabic are still immature. The main reason that the resources in Arabic are insufficient is that Arabic has many dialects in addition to the standard version (MSA). Arabs do not use MSA in their daily communications; rather, they use dialectal versions. Unfortunately, social users transfer this phenomenon into their use of social media platforms, which in turn has raised an urgent need for building suitable AI models for language-dependent applications. Existing machine translation (MT) systems designed for MSA fail to work well with Arabic dialects. In light of this, it is necessary to adapt to the informal nature of communication on social networks by developing MT systems that can effectively handle the various dialects of Arabic. Unlike for MSA that shows advanced progress in MT systems, little effort has been exerted to utilize Arabic dialects for MT systems. While few attempts have been made to build translation datasets for dialectal Arabic, they are domain dependent and are not OSN cultural-language friendly. In this work, we attempt to alleviate these limitations by proposing an online social network-based multidialect Arabic dataset that is crafted by contextually translating English tweets into four Arabic dialects: Gulf, Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine. To perform the translation, we followed our proposed guideline framework for content translation, which could be universally applicable for translation between foreign languages and local dialects. We validated the authenticity of our proposed dataset by developing neural MT models for four Arabic dialects. Our results have shown a superior performance of our NMT models trained using our dataset. We believe that our dataset can reliably serve as an Arabic multidialectal translation dataset for informal MT tasks.

                  We present NeuralLabeling, a labeling approach and toolset for annotating a scene using either bounding boxes or meshes and generating segmentation masks, affordance maps, 2D bounding boxes, 3D bounding boxes, 6DOF object poses, depth maps and object meshes. NeuralLabeling uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as renderer, allowing labeling to be performed using 3D spatial tools while incorporating geometric clues such as occlusions, relying only on images captured from multiple viewpoints as input. To demonstrate the applicability of NeuralLabeling to a practical problem in robotics, we added ground truth depth maps to 30000 frames of transparent object RGB and noisy depth maps of glasses placed in a dishwasher captured using an RGBD sensor, yielding the Dishwasher30k dataset. We show that training a simple deep neural network with supervision using the annotated depth maps yields a higher reconstruction performance than training with the previously applied weakly supervised approach.

                  Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant priority in text understanding and generation. However, LLMs suffer from the risk of generating harmful contents especially while being employed to applications. There are several black-box attack methods, such as Prompt Attack, which can change the behaviour of LLMs and induce LLMs to generate unexpected answers with harmful contents. Researchers are interested in Prompt Attack and Defense with LLMs, while there is no publicly available dataset to evaluate the abilities of defending prompt attack. In this paper, we introduce a Chinese Prompt Attack Dataset for LLMs, called CPAD. Our prompts aim to induce LLMs to generate unexpected outputs with several carefully designed prompt attack approaches and widely concerned attacking contents. Different from previous datasets involving safety estimation, We construct the prompts considering three dimensions: contents, attacking methods and goals, thus the responses can be easily evaluated and analysed. We run several well-known Chinese LLMs on our dataset, and the results show that our prompts are significantly harmful to LLMs, with around 70% attack success rate. We will release CPAD to encourage further studies on prompt attack and defense.

                  Sentiments inherently drive politics. How we receive and process information plays an essential role in political decision-making, shaping our judgment with strategic consequences both on the level of legislators and the masses. If sentiment plays such an important role in politics, how can we study and measure it systematically? The paper presents a new dataset of sentiment-annotated sentences, which are used in a series of experiments focused on training a robust sentiment classifier for parliamentary proceedings. The paper also introduces the first domain-specific LLM for political science applications additionally pre-trained on 1.72 billion domain-specific words from proceedings of 27 European parliaments. We present experiments demonstrating how the additional pre-training of LLM on parliamentary data can significantly improve the model downstream performance on the domain-specific tasks, in our case, sentiment detection in parliamentary proceedings. We further show that multilingual models perform very well on unseen languages and that additional data from other languages significantly improves the target parliament's results. The paper makes an important contribution to multiple domains of social sciences and bridges them with computer science and computational linguistics. Lastly, it sets up a more robust approach to sentiment analysis of political texts in general, which allows scholars to study political sentiment from a comparative perspective using standardized tools and techniques.

                  The heterogeneous computing paradigm has led to the need for portable and efficient programming solutions that can leverage the capabilities of various hardware devices, such as NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD GPUs. This study evaluates the portability and performance of the SYCL and CUDA languages for one fundamental bioinformatics application (Smith-Waterman protein database search) across different GPU architectures, considering single and multi-GPU configurations from different vendors. The experimental work showed that, while both CUDA and SYCL versions achieve similar performance on NVIDIA devices, the latter demonstrated remarkable code portability to other GPU architectures, such as AMD and Intel. Furthermore, the architectural efficiency rates achieved on these devices were superior in 3 of the 4 cases tested. This brief study highlights the potential of SYCL as a viable solution for achieving both performance and portability in the heterogeneous computing ecosystem.

                  Large scale language models (LLM) have received significant attention and found diverse applications across various domains, but their development encounters challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise due to the scarcity of public domain data availability and the need to maintain privacy with respect to private domain data. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technology that enables collaborative training of shared models while preserving decentralized data. We propose the concept of federated LLM, which comprises three key components, i.e., federated LLM pre-training, federated LLM fine-tuning, and federated LLM prompt engineering. For each component, we discuss its advantage over traditional LLM training methods and propose specific engineering strategies for implementation. Furthermore, we explore the novel challenges introduced by the integration of FL and LLM. We analyze existing solutions and identify potential obstacles faced by these solutions within the context of federated LLM.

                  Recently, the release of INSTRUCTEVAL has provided valuable insights into the performance of large language models (LLMs) that utilize encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture. Interestingly, despite being introduced four years ago, T5-based LLMs, such as FLAN-T5, continue to outperform the latest decoder-based LLMs, such as LLAMA and VICUNA, on tasks that require general problem-solving skills. This performance discrepancy can be attributed to three key factors: (1) Pre-training data, (2) Backbone architecture, and (3) Instruction dataset. In this technical report, our main focus is on investigating the impact of the third factor by leveraging VICUNA, a large language model based on LLAMA, which has undergone fine-tuning on ChatGPT conversations. To achieve this objective, we fine-tuned VICUNA using a customized instruction dataset collection called FLANMINI. This collection includes a subset of the large-scale instruction dataset known as FLAN, as well as various code-related datasets and conversational datasets derived from ChatGPT/GPT-4. This dataset comprises a large number of tasks that demand problem-solving skills. Our experimental findings strongly indicate that the enhanced problem-solving abilities of our model, FLACUNA, are obtained through fine-tuning VICUNA on the FLAN dataset, leading to significant improvements across numerous benchmark datasets in INSTRUCTEVAL. FLACUNA is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flacuna-13b-v1.0.

                  ChatGPT can improve Software Engineering (SE) research practices by offering efficient, accessible information analysis and synthesis based on natural language interactions. However, ChatGPT could bring ethical challenges, encompassing plagiarism, privacy, data security, and the risk of generating biased or potentially detrimental data. This research aims to fill the given gap by elaborating on the key elements: motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature survey, identified the mentioned elements, and presented their relationships by developing a taxonomy. Further, the identified literature-based elements (motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles) were empirically evaluated by conducting a comprehensive questionnaire-based survey involving SE researchers. Additionally, we employed Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) approach to analyze the relationships between the ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research and develop a level based decision model. We further conducted a Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to create a cluster-based decision model. These models aim to help SE researchers devise effective strategies for ethically integrating ChatGPT into SE research by following the identified principles through adopting the motivators and addressing the demotivators. The findings of this study will establish a benchmark for incorporating ChatGPT services in SE research with an emphasis on ethical considerations.

                  This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified. A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly evolving field of content generation.

                  Existing text summarization systems have made significant progress in recent years but typically generates summaries in a single step. The one-shot summarization setting is sometimes inadequate, however, as the generated summary may contain hallucinations or overlook important details related to the reader's interests. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing SummIt, an iterative text summarization framework based on large language models like ChatGPT. Our framework enables the model to refine the generated summary iteratively through self-evaluation and feedback, closely resembling the iterative process humans undertake when drafting and revising summaries. We also explore using in-context learning to guide the rationale generation and summary refinement. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating knowledge and topic extractors into the framework to enhance summary faithfulness and controllability. We evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark summarization datasets through empirical and qualitative analyses. We also conduct a human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the model's refinements and find a potential issue of over-correction.

                  Empowering chatbots in the field of mental health is receiving increasing amount of attention, while there still lacks exploration in developing and evaluating chatbots in psychiatric outpatient scenarios. In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots for psychiatrist and patient simulation. We collaborate with psychiatrists to identify objectives and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. In the evaluation experiments, we recruit real psychiatrists and patients to engage in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT-powered chatbots in psychiatric scenarios and explore the impact of prompt designs on chatbot behavior and user experience.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.
