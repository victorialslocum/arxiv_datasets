                  Large multimodal datasets have been instrumental in recent breakthroughs such as CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and GPT-4. At the same time, datasets rarely receive the same research attention as model architectures or training algorithms. To address this shortcoming in the machine learning ecosystem, we introduce DataComp, a benchmark where the training code is fixed and researchers innovate by proposing new training sets. We provide a testbed for dataset experiments centered around a new candidate pool of 12.8B image-text pairs from Common Crawl. Participants in our benchmark design new filtering techniques or curate new data sources and then evaluate their new dataset by running our standardized CLIP training code and testing on 38 downstream test sets. Our benchmark consists of multiple scales, with four candidate pool sizes and associated compute budgets ranging from 12.8M to 12.8B samples seen during training. This multi-scale design facilitates the study of scaling trends and makes the benchmark accessible to researchers with varying resources.   Our baseline experiments show that the DataComp workflow is a promising way of improving multimodal datasets. We introduce DataComp-1B, a dataset created by applying a simple filtering algorithm to the 12.8B candidate pool. The resulting 1.4B subset enables training a CLIP ViT-L/14 from scratch to 79.2% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Our new ViT-L/14 model outperforms a larger ViT-g/14 trained on LAION-2B by 0.7 percentage points while requiring 9x less training compute. We also outperform OpenAI's CLIP ViT-L/14 by 3.7 percentage points, which is trained with the same compute budget as our model. These gains highlight the potential for improving model performance by carefully curating training sets. We view DataComp-1B as only the first step and hope that DataComp paves the way toward the next generation of multimodal datasets.

                  In recent years, the field of medicine has been increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to provide faster and more accurate disease detection, prediction, and assessment. In this study, we propose an interpretable AI approach to diagnose patients with neurofibromatosis using blood tests and pathogenic variables. We evaluated the proposed method using a dataset from the AACR GENIE project and compared its performance with modern approaches. Our proposed approach outperformed existing models with 99.86% accuracy. We also conducted NF1 and interpretable AI tests to validate our approach. Our work provides an explainable approach model using logistic regression and explanatory stimulus as well as a black-box model. The explainable models help to explain the predictions of black-box models while the glass-box models provide information about the best-fit features. Overall, our study presents an interpretable AI approach for diagnosing patients with neurofibromatosis and demonstrates the potential of AI in the medical field.

                  In the field of computer- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, enormous progress has been made in recent years based on the recognition of surgical instruments in endoscopic images. Especially the determination of the position and type of the instruments is of great interest here. Current work involves both spatial and temporal information with the idea, that the prediction of movement of surgical tools over time may improve the quality of final segmentations. The provision of publicly available datasets has recently encouraged the development of new methods, mainly based on deep learning. In this review, we identify datasets used for method development and evaluation, as well as quantify their frequency of use in the literature. We further present an overview of the current state of research regarding the segmentation and tracking of minimally invasive surgical instruments in endoscopic images. The paper focuses on methods that work purely visually without attached markers of any kind on the instruments, taking into account both single-frame segmentation approaches as well as those involving temporal information. A discussion of the reviewed literature is provided, highlighting existing shortcomings and emphasizing available potential for future developments. The publications considered were identified through the platforms Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed. The search terms used were "instrument segmentation", "instrument tracking", "surgical tool segmentation", and "surgical tool tracking" and result in 408 articles published between 2015 and 2022 from which 109 were included using systematic selection criteria.

                  3D dense reconstruction refers to the process of obtaining the complete shape and texture features of 3D objects from 2D planar images. 3D reconstruction is an important and extensively studied problem, but it is far from being solved. This work systematically introduces classical methods of 3D dense reconstruction based on geometric and optical models, as well as methods based on deep learning. It also introduces datasets for deep learning and the performance and advantages and disadvantages demonstrated by deep learning methods on these datasets.

                  The MIND dataset is at the moment of writing the most extensive dataset available for the research and development of news recommender systems. This work analyzes the suitability of the dataset for research on diverse news recommendations. On the one hand we analyze the effect the different steps in the recommendation pipeline have on the distribution of article categories, and on the other hand we check whether the supplied data would be sufficient for more sophisticated diversity analysis. We conclude that while MIND is a great step forward, there is still a lot of room for improvement.

                Why Existing Multimodal Crowd Counting Datasets Can Lead to Unfulfilled Expectations in Real-World Applications

                  More information leads to better decisions and predictions, right? Confirming this hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical and thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting. However, the way multimodal models extract enriched features from both modalities is not yet fully understood. Since the use of multimodal data usually increases the complexity, inference time, and memory requirements of the models, it is relevant to examine the differences and advantages of multimodal compared to monomodal models. In this work, all available multimodal datasets for crowd counting are used to investigate the differences between monomodal and multimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that considers the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In addition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different multimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal architecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general. Surprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the existing datasets. We found that the existing datasets hold a bias toward thermal images. This was determined by analyzing the relationship between the brightness of optical images and crowd count as well as examining the annotations made for each dataset. Since answering this question is important for future real-world applications of crowd counting, this paper establishes criteria for a potential dataset suitable for answering whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general.

                BugNIST -- A New Large Scale Volumetric 3D Image Dataset for Classification and Detection

                  Progress in 3D volumetric image analysis research is limited by the lack of datasets and most advances in analysis methods for volumetric images are based on medical data. However, medical data do not necessarily resemble the characteristics of other volumetric images such as micro-CT. To promote research in 3D volumetric image analysis beyond medical data, we have created the BugNIST dataset and made it freely available. BugNIST is an extensive dataset of micro-CT scans of 12 types of bugs, such as insects and larvae. BugNIST contains 9437 volumes where 9087 are of individual bugs and 350 are mixtures of bugs and other material. The goal of BugNIST is to benchmark classification and detection methods, and we have designed the detection challenge such that detection models are trained on scans of individual bugs and tested on bug mixtures. Models capable of solving this task will be independent of the context, i.e., the surrounding material. This is a great advantage if the context is unknown or changing, as is often the case in micro-CT. Our initial baseline analysis shows that current state-of-the-art deep learning methods classify individual bugs very well, but has great difficulty with the detection challenge. Hereby, BugNIST enables research in image analysis areas that until now have missed relevant data - both classification, detection, and hopefully more.

                  Compared to general document analysis tasks, form document structure understanding and retrieval are challenging. Form documents are typically made by two types of authors; A form designer, who develops the form structure and keys, and a form user, who fills out form values based on the provided keys. Hence, the form values may not be aligned with the form designer's intention (structure and keys) if a form user gets confused. In this paper, we introduce Form-NLU, the first novel dataset for form structure understanding and its key and value information extraction, interpreting the form designer's intent and the alignment of user-written value on it. It consists of 857 form images, 6k form keys and values, and 4k table keys and values. Our dataset also includes three form types: digital, printed, and handwritten, which cover diverse form appearances and layouts. We propose a robust positional and logical relation-based form key-value information extraction framework. Using this dataset, Form-NLU, we first examine strong object detection models for the form layout understanding, then evaluate the key information extraction task on the dataset, providing fine-grained results for different types of forms and keys. Furthermore, we examine it with the off-the-shelf pdf layout extraction tool and prove its feasibility in real-world cases.

                  While the availability of large and diverse datasets has contributed to significant breakthroughs in autonomous driving and indoor applications, forestry applications are still lagging behind and new forest datasets would most certainly contribute to achieving significant progress in the development of data-driven methods for forest-like scenarios. This paper introduces a forest dataset called \textit{FinnWoodlands}, which consists of RGB stereo images, point clouds, and sparse depth maps, as well as ground truth manual annotations for semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. \textit{FinnWoodlands} comprises a total of 4226 objects manually annotated, out of which 2562 objects (60.6\%) correspond to tree trunks classified into three different instance categories, namely "Spruce Tree", "Birch Tree", and "Pine Tree". Besides tree trunks, we also annotated "Obstacles" objects as instances as well as the semantic stuff classes "Lake", "Ground", and "Track". Our dataset can be used in forestry applications where a holistic representation of the environment is relevant. We provide an initial benchmark using three models for instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and depth completion, and illustrate the challenges that such unstructured scenarios introduce.

                  We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a dedicated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our camera system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during training. We also propose a new model and a new training strategy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn representation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.

                  Instrument playing technique (IPT) is a key element of musical presentation. However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin, indicating its effectiveness in IPT detection.

                  Machine learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks (NNs), are a valuable tool used to approximate non-linear relationships, like the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF), with considerable accuracy -- and achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude when deployed for use. Often in power systems literature, the NNs are trained with a fixed dataset generated prior to the training process. In this paper, we show that adapting the NN training dataset during training can improve the NN performance and substantially reduce its worst-case violations. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and enriches the training dataset with critical datapoints that reduce the worst-case violations and deliver a neural network with improved worst-case performance guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in four test power systems, ranging from 39-buses to 162-buses.

                  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its effectiveness in segmenting any object/part in various 2D images, yet its ability for 3D has not been fully explored. The real world is composed of numerous 3D scenes and objects. Due to the scarcity of accessible 3D data and high cost of its acquisition and annotation, lifting SAM to 3D is a challenging but valuable research avenue. With this in mind, we propose a novel framework to Segment Anything in 3D, named SA3D. Given a neural radiance field (NeRF) model, SA3D allows users to obtain the 3D segmentation result of any target object via only one-shot manual prompting in a single rendered view. With input prompts, SAM cuts out the target object from the according view. The obtained 2D segmentation mask is projected onto 3D mask grids via density-guided inverse rendering. 2D masks from other views are then rendered, which are mostly uncompleted but used as cross-view self-prompts to be fed into SAM again. Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning. The entire segmentation process can be completed in approximately two minutes without any engineering optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SA3D in different scenes, highlighting the potential of SAM in 3D scene perception. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/.

                  Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

                  The success of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, has led to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g., ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

                  This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.

                  The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly conversational LLMs like ChatGPT, have prompted changes in a range of fields, including design. This study aims to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in a human-centered design process. To this end, a hypothetical design project was conducted, where ChatGPT was utilized to generate personas, simulate interviews with fictional users, create new design ideas, simulate usage scenarios and conversations between an imaginary prototype and fictional users, and lastly evaluate user experience. The results show that ChatGPT effectively performed the tasks assigned to it as a designer, user, or product, providing mostly appropriate responses. The study does, however, highlight some drawbacks such as forgotten information, partial responses, and a lack of output diversity. The paper explains the potential benefits and limitations of using conversational LLMs in design, discusses its implications, and suggests directions for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

                  Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.

                  Explaining the black-box predictions of NLP models naturally and accurately is an important open problem in natural language generation. These free-text explanations are expected to contain sufficient and carefully-selected evidence to form supportive arguments for predictions. Due to the superior generative capacity of large pretrained language models, recent work built on prompt engineering enables explanation generation without specific training. However, explanation generated through single-pass prompting often lacks sufficiency and conciseness. To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise. Our approach regenerates the free-text explanation by polishing the single-pass output from the pretrained language model but retaining the information that supports the contents being explained. Experiments on two out-of-domain tasks verify the effectiveness of EIB through automatic evaluation and thoroughly-conducted human evaluation.

                Fill in the Blank: Context-aware Automated Text Input Generation for Mobile GUI Testing

                  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

                Multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A

                  We present a multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A within the internal shock scenario. We consider the time-dependent evolution of the outflow with its impact on the observed light curve from multiple collisions, and the self-consistent generation of the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\sim1$~s. We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum. Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.
