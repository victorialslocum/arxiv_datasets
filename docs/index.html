                  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are pretrained on large, diverse, and noisy web-crawled datasets. This underscores the critical need for dataset pruning, as the quality of these datasets is strongly correlated with the performance of VLMs on downstream tasks. Using CLIPScore from a pretrained model to only train models using highly-aligned samples is one of the most successful methods for pruning.We argue that this approach suffers from multiple limitations including: 1) false positives due to spurious correlations captured by the pretrained CLIP model, 2) false negatives due to poor discrimination between hard and bad samples, and 3) biased ranking towards samples similar to the pretrained CLIP dataset. We propose a pruning method, SIEVE, that employs synthetic captions generated by image-captioning models pretrained on small, diverse, and well-aligned image-text pairs to evaluate the alignment of noisy image-text pairs. To bridge the gap between the limited diversity of generated captions and the high diversity of alternative text (alt-text), we estimate the semantic textual similarity in the embedding space of a language model pretrained on billions of sentences. Using DataComp, a multimodal dataset filtering benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the large scale pool, and competitive results on the medium scale pool, surpassing CLIPScore-based filtering by 1.7% and 2.6% on average, on 38 downstream tasks.

                  The use of audio and visual modality for speaker localization has been well studied in the literature by exploiting their complementary characteristics. However, most previous works employ the setting of static sensors mounted at fixed positions. Unlike them, in this work, we explore the ego-centric setting, where the heterogeneous sensors are embodied and could be moving with a human to facilitate speaker localization. Compared to the static scenario, the ego-centric setting is more realistic for smart-home applications e.g., a service robot. However, this also brings new challenges such as blurred images, frequent speaker disappearance from the field of view of the wearer, and occlusions. In this paper, we study egocentric audio-visual speaker DOA estimation and deal with the challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based audio-visual fusion method to estimate the relative DOA of the speaker to the wearer, and design a training strategy to mitigate the problem of the speaker disappearing from the camera's view. We also develop a new dataset for simulating the out-of-view scenarios, by creating a scene with a camera wearer walking around while a speaker is moving at the same time. The experimental results show that our proposed method offers promising performance in this new dataset in terms of tracking accuracy. Finally, we adapt the proposed method for the multi-speaker scenario. Experiments on EasyCom show the effectiveness of the proposed model for multiple speakers in real scenarios, which achieves state-of-the-art results in the sphere active speaker detection task and the wearer activity prediction task. The simulated dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/KawhiZhao/Egocentric-Audio-Visual-Speaker-Localization.

                  In recent years, static meshes with texture maps have become one of the most prevalent digital representations of 3D shapes in various applications, such as animation, gaming, medical imaging, and cultural heritage applications. However, little research has been done on the quality assessment of textured meshes, which hinders the development of quality-oriented applications, such as mesh compression and enhancement. In this paper, we create a large-scale textured mesh quality assessment database, namely SJTU-TMQA, which includes 21 reference meshes and 945 distorted samples. The meshes are rendered into processed video sequences and then conduct subjective experiments to obtain mean opinion scores (MOS). The diversity of content and accuracy of MOS has been shown to validate its heterogeneity and reliability. The impact of various types of distortion on human perception is demonstrated. 13 state-of-the-art objective metrics are evaluated on SJTU-TMQA. The results report the highest correlation of around 0.6, indicating the need for more effective objective metrics. The SJTU-TMQA is available at https://ccccby.github.io

                  In this work we introduce the CitrusFarm dataset, a comprehensive multimodal sensory dataset collected by a wheeled mobile robot operating in agricultural fields. The dataset offers stereo RGB images with depth information, as well as monochrome, near-infrared and thermal images, presenting diverse spectral responses crucial for agricultural research. Furthermore, it provides a range of navigational sensor data encompassing wheel odometry, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GNSS with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) as the centimeter-level positioning ground truth. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected in three fields of citrus trees, featuring various tree species at different growth stages, distinctive planting patterns, as well as varying daylight conditions. It spans a total operation time of 1.7 hours, covers a distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 1.3 TB of data. We anticipate that this dataset can facilitate the development of autonomous robot systems operating in agricultural tree environments, especially for localization, mapping and crop monitoring tasks. Moreover, the rich sensing modalities offered in this dataset can also support research in a range of robotics and computer vision tasks, such as place recognition, scene understanding, object detection and segmentation, and multimodal learning. The dataset, in conjunction with related tools and resources, is made publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/Citrus-Farm-Dataset.

                  Object-centric event data represent processes from the point of view of all the involved object types. This perspective has gained interest in recent years as it supports the analysis of processes that previously could not be adequately captured, due to the lack of a clear case notion as well as an increasing amount of output data that needs to be stored. Although publicly available event logs are crucial artifacts for researchers to develop and evaluate novel process mining techniques, the currently available object-centric event logs have limitations in this regard. Specifically, they mainly focus on control-flow and rarely contain objects with attributes that change over time, even though this is not realistic, as the attribute values of objects can be altered during their lifecycle. This paper addresses this gap by providing two means of establishing object-centric datasets with dynamically evolving attributes. First, we provide event log generators, which allow researchers to generate customized, artificial logs with dynamic attributes in the recently proposed DOCEL format. Second, we propose and evaluate an algorithm to convert OCEL logs into DOCEL logs, which involves the detection of event attributes that capture evolving object information and the creation of dynamic attributes from these. Through these contributions, this paper supports the advancement of object-centric process analysis by providing researchers with new means to obtain relevant data to use during the development of new techniques.

                  Sentiments inherently drive politics. How we receive and process information plays an essential role in political decision-making, shaping our judgment with strategic consequences both on the level of legislators and the masses. If sentiment plays such an important role in politics, how can we study and measure it systematically? The paper presents a new dataset of sentiment-annotated sentences, which are used in a series of experiments focused on training a robust sentiment classifier for parliamentary proceedings. The paper also introduces the first domain-specific LLM for political science applications additionally pre-trained on 1.72 billion domain-specific words from proceedings of 27 European parliaments. We present experiments demonstrating how the additional pre-training of LLM on parliamentary data can significantly improve the model downstream performance on the domain-specific tasks, in our case, sentiment detection in parliamentary proceedings. We further show that multilingual models perform very well on unseen languages and that additional data from other languages significantly improves the target parliament's results. The paper makes an important contribution to multiple domains of social sciences and bridges them with computer science and computational linguistics. Lastly, it sets up a more robust approach to sentiment analysis of political texts in general, which allows scholars to study political sentiment from a comparative perspective using standardized tools and techniques.

                  The heterogeneous computing paradigm has led to the need for portable and efficient programming solutions that can leverage the capabilities of various hardware devices, such as NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD GPUs. This study evaluates the portability and performance of the SYCL and CUDA languages for one fundamental bioinformatics application (Smith-Waterman protein database search) across different GPU architectures, considering single and multi-GPU configurations from different vendors. The experimental work showed that, while both CUDA and SYCL versions achieve similar performance on NVIDIA devices, the latter demonstrated remarkable code portability to other GPU architectures, such as AMD and Intel. Furthermore, the architectural efficiency rates achieved on these devices were superior in 3 of the 4 cases tested. This brief study highlights the potential of SYCL as a viable solution for achieving both performance and portability in the heterogeneous computing ecosystem.

                  Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

                  Backdoor attack aims to compromise a model, which returns an adversary-wanted output when a specific trigger pattern appears yet behaves normally for clean inputs. Current backdoor attacks require changing pixels of clean images, which results in poor stealthiness of attacks and increases the difficulty of the physical implementation. This paper proposes a novel physical invisible backdoor based on camera imaging without changing nature image pixels. Specifically, a compromised model returns a target label for images taken by a particular camera, while it returns correct results for other images. To implement and evaluate the proposed backdoor, we take shots of different objects from multi-angles using multiple smartphones to build a new dataset of 21,500 images. Conventional backdoor attacks work ineffectively with some classical models, such as ResNet18, over the above-mentioned dataset. Therefore, we propose a three-step training strategy to mount the backdoor attack. First, we design and train a camera identification model with the phone IDs to extract the camera fingerprint feature. Subsequently, we elaborate a special network architecture, which is easily compromised by our backdoor attack, by leveraging the attributes of the CFA interpolation algorithm and combining it with the feature extraction block in the camera identification model. Finally, we transfer the backdoor from the elaborated special network architecture to the classical architecture model via teacher-student distillation learning. Since the trigger of our method is related to the specific phone, our attack works effectively in the physical world. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach and robustness against various backdoor defenses.

                  Many fields are experiencing a Big Data explosion, with data collection rates outpacing the rate of computing performance improvements predicted by Moore's Law.   Researchers are often interested in similarity search on such data.   We present CAKES (CLAM-Accelerated $K$-NN Entropy Scaling Search), a novel algorithm for $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$-NN) search which leverages geometric and topological properties inherent in large datasets.   CAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and performs best when data occupy a low dimensional manifold, even if the data occupy a very high dimensional embedding space.   We demonstrate performance improvements ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of times faster when compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as FAISS and HNSW, when benchmarked on 5 standard datasets.   Unlike locality-sensitive hashing approaches, CAKES can work with any user-defined distance function.   When data occupy a metric space, CAKES exhibits perfect recall.

                  Data integration is a notoriously difficult and heuristic-driven process, especially when ground-truth data are not readily available. This paper presents a measure of uncertainty by providing maximal and minimal ranges of a query outcome in two-table, one-to-many data integration workflows. Users can use these query results to guide a search through different matching parameters, similarity metrics, and constraints. Even though there are exponentially many such matchings, we show that in appropriately constrained circumstances that this result range can be calculated in polynomial time with bipartite graph matching. We evaluate this on real-world datasets and synthetic datasets, and find that uncertainty estimates are more robust when a graph-matching based approach is used for data integration.

                  We present Belebele, a multiple-choice machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset enables the evaluation of text models in high-, medium-, and low-resource languages. Each question is based on a short passage from the Flores-200 dataset and has four multiple-choice answers. The questions were carefully curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results and find that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still understand far more languages. We also observe that larger vocabulary size and conscious vocabulary construction correlate with better performance on low-resource languages. Overall, Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating and analyzing the multilingual capabilities of NLP systems.

                  One of the critical phases in software development is software testing. Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs. The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of tests by suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. While the code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature has acknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency of tests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, we introduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMs in terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achieved by augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight the limitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generating effective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of the Program Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluate their performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposed method is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets. Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fully automated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learning approaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57% on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generate test cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance the effectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic or functional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs and testing corner cases PUTs.

                  Large scale language models (LLM) have received significant attention and found diverse applications across various domains, but their development encounters challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise due to the scarcity of public domain data availability and the need to maintain privacy with respect to private domain data. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technology that enables collaborative training of shared models while preserving decentralized data. We propose the concept of federated LLM, which comprises three key components, i.e., federated LLM pre-training, federated LLM fine-tuning, and federated LLM prompt engineering. For each component, we discuss its advantage over traditional LLM training methods and propose specific engineering strategies for implementation. Furthermore, we explore the novel challenges introduced by the integration of FL and LLM. We analyze existing solutions and identify potential obstacles faced by these solutions within the context of federated LLM.

                  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a proven approach to secure networks. However, in a privately used network, it is difficult for users without cybersecurity expertise to understand IDS alerts, and to respond in time with adequate measures. This puts the security of home networks, smart home installations, home-office workers, etc. at risk, even if an IDS is correctly installed and configured. In this work, we propose ChatIDS, our approach to explain IDS alerts to non-experts by using large language models. We evaluate the feasibility of ChatIDS by using ChatGPT, and we identify open research issues with the help of interdisciplinary experts in artificial intelligence. Our results show that ChatIDS has the potential to increase network security by proposing meaningful security measures in an intuitive language from IDS alerts. Nevertheless, some potential issues in areas such as trust, privacy, ethics, etc. need to be resolved, before ChatIDS might be put into practice.

                  ChatGPT can improve Software Engineering (SE) research practices by offering efficient, accessible information analysis and synthesis based on natural language interactions. However, ChatGPT could bring ethical challenges, encompassing plagiarism, privacy, data security, and the risk of generating biased or potentially detrimental data. This research aims to fill the given gap by elaborating on the key elements: motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature survey, identified the mentioned elements, and presented their relationships by developing a taxonomy. Further, the identified literature-based elements (motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles) were empirically evaluated by conducting a comprehensive questionnaire-based survey involving SE researchers. Additionally, we employed Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) approach to analyze the relationships between the ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research and develop a level based decision model. We further conducted a Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to create a cluster-based decision model. These models aim to help SE researchers devise effective strategies for ethically integrating ChatGPT into SE research by following the identified principles through adopting the motivators and addressing the demotivators. The findings of this study will establish a benchmark for incorporating ChatGPT services in SE research with an emphasis on ethical considerations.

                  This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified. A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly evolving field of content generation.

                  Existing text summarization systems have made significant progress in recent years but typically generates summaries in a single step. The one-shot summarization setting is sometimes inadequate, however, as the generated summary may contain hallucinations or overlook important details related to the reader's interests. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing SummIt, an iterative text summarization framework based on large language models like ChatGPT. Our framework enables the model to refine the generated summary iteratively through self-evaluation and feedback, closely resembling the iterative process humans undertake when drafting and revising summaries. We also explore using in-context learning to guide the rationale generation and summary refinement. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating knowledge and topic extractors into the framework to enhance summary faithfulness and controllability. We evaluate the performance of our framework on three benchmark summarization datasets through empirical and qualitative analyses. We also conduct a human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the model's refinements and find a potential issue of over-correction.

                  Empowering chatbots in the field of mental health is receiving increasing amount of attention, while there still lacks exploration in developing and evaluating chatbots in psychiatric outpatient scenarios. In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots for psychiatrist and patient simulation. We collaborate with psychiatrists to identify objectives and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. In the evaluation experiments, we recruit real psychiatrists and patients to engage in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT-powered chatbots in psychiatric scenarios and explore the impact of prompt designs on chatbot behavior and user experience.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  Large language models (LLMs) have shown surprisingly good performance in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) even when trained without parallel data. Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data is gigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly for low-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages on LLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how should we mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x ChrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate the importance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as the superiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).
