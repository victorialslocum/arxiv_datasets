                  3D dense reconstruction refers to the process of obtaining the complete shape and texture features of 3D objects from 2D planar images. 3D reconstruction is an important and extensively studied problem, but it is far from being solved. This work systematically introduces classical methods of 3D dense reconstruction based on geometric and optical models, as well as methods based on deep learning. It also introduces datasets for deep learning and the performance and advantages and disadvantages demonstrated by deep learning methods on these datasets.

                  Lifelogging has gained more attention due to its wide applications, such as personalized recommendations or memory assistance. The issues of collecting and extracting personal life events have emerged. People often share their life experiences with others through conversations. However, extracting life events from conversations is rarely explored. In this paper, we present Life Event Dialog, a dataset containing fine-grained life event annotations on conversational data. In addition, we initiate a novel conversational life event extraction task and differentiate the task from the public event extraction or the life event extraction from other sources like microblogs. We explore three information extraction (IE) frameworks to address the conversational life event extraction task: OpenIE, relation extraction, and event extraction. A comprehensive empirical analysis of the three baselines is established. The results suggest that the current event extraction model still struggles with extracting life events from human daily conversations. Our proposed life event dialog dataset and in-depth analysis of IE frameworks will facilitate future research on life event extraction from conversations.

                  Human pose estimation (HPE) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for indoor monitoring is one of the major challenges in computer vision. In contrast to HPE in perspective views, an indoor monitoring system can consist of an omnidirectional camera with a field of view of 180{\deg} to detect the pose of a person with only one sensor per room. To recognize human pose, the detection of keypoints is an essential upstream step. In our work we propose a new dataset for training and evaluation of CNNs for the task of keypoint detection in omnidirectional images. The training dataset, THEODORE+, consists of 50,000 images and is created by a 3D rendering engine, where humans are randomly walking through an indoor environment. In a dynamically created 3D scene, persons move randomly with simultaneously moving omnidirectional camera to generate synthetic RGB images and 2D and 3D ground truth. For evaluation purposes, the real-world PoseFES dataset with two scenarios and 701 frames with up to eight persons per scene was captured and annotated. We propose four training paradigms to finetune or re-train two top-down models in MMPose and two bottom-up models in CenterNet on THEODORE+. Beside a qualitative evaluation we report quantitative results. Compared to a COCO pretrained baseline, we achieve significant improvements especially for top-view scenes on the PoseFES dataset.

                Why Existing Multimodal Crowd Counting Datasets Can Lead to Unfulfilled Expectations in Real-World Applications

                  More information leads to better decisions and predictions, right? Confirming this hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical and thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting. However, the way multimodal models extract enriched features from both modalities is not yet fully understood. Since the use of multimodal data usually increases the complexity, inference time, and memory requirements of the models, it is relevant to examine the differences and advantages of multimodal compared to monomodal models. In this work, all available multimodal datasets for crowd counting are used to investigate the differences between monomodal and multimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that considers the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In addition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different multimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal architecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general. Surprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the existing datasets. We found that the existing datasets hold a bias toward thermal images. This was determined by analyzing the relationship between the brightness of optical images and crowd count as well as examining the annotations made for each dataset. Since answering this question is important for future real-world applications of crowd counting, this paper establishes criteria for a potential dataset suitable for answering whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general.

                  Though research has shown the complementarity of camera- and inertial-based data, datasets which offer both modalities remain scarce. In this paper we introduce WEAR, a multimodal benchmark dataset for both vision- and wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The dataset comprises data from 18 participants performing a total of 18 different workout activities with untrimmed inertial (acceleration) and camera (egocentric video) data recorded at 10 different outside locations. WEAR features a diverse set of activities which are low in inter-class similarity and, unlike previous egocentric datasets, not defined by human-object-interactions nor originate from inherently distinct activity categories. Provided benchmark results reveal that single-modality architectures have different strengths and weaknesses in their prediction performance. Further, in light of the recent success of transformer-based video action detection models, we demonstrate their versatility by applying them in a plain fashion using vision, inertial and combined (vision + inertial) features as input. Results show that vision transformers are not only able to produce competitive results using only inertial data, but also can function as an architecture to fuse both modalities by means of simple concatenation, with the multimodal approach being able to produce the highest average mAP, precision and close-to-best F1-scores. Up until now, vision-based transformers have neither been explored in inertial nor in multimodal human activity recognition, making our approach the first to do so. The dataset and code to reproduce experiments is publicly available via: mariusbock.github.io/wear

                  Mathematical inequalities, combined with atomic-physics sum rules, enable one to derive lower and upper bounds for the Rosseland and/or Planck mean opacities. The resulting constraints must be satisfied, either for pure elements or mixtures. The intriguing law of anomalous numbers, also named Benford's law, is of great interest to detect errors in line-strength collections required for fine-structure calculations. Testing regularities may reveal hidden properties, such as the fractal nature of complex atomic spectra. The aforementioned constraints can also be useful to assess the reliability of experimental measurements. Finally, we recall that it is important to quantify the uncertainties due to interpolations in density-temperature opacity (or more generally atomic-data) tables, and that convergence studies are of course unavoidable in order to address the issue of completeness in terms of levels, configurations or superconfigurations, which is a cornerstone of opacity calculations.

                  Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website. We hope that SportsPose will allow researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more effective models for the analysis of sports performance and injury prevention. With its realistic and diverse dataset, SportsPose provides a valuable resource for advancing the state-of-the-art in pose estimation in sports.

                  Relation extraction is a central task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research. We argue that an important type of relation not explored in NLP or IR research to date is that of an event being an argument - required or optional - of another event. We introduce the human-annotated Event Dependency Relation dataset (EDeR) which provides this dependency relation. The annotation is done on a sample of documents from the OntoNotes dataset, which has the added benefit that it integrates with existing, orthogonal, annotations of this dataset. We investigate baseline approaches for predicting the event dependency relation, the best of which achieves an accuracy of 82.61 for binary argument/non-argument classification. We show that recognizing this relation leads to more accurate event extraction (semantic role labelling) and can improve downstream tasks that depend on this, such as co-reference resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predicting the three-way classification into the required argument, optional argument or non-argument is a more challenging task.

                  While the availability of large and diverse datasets has contributed to significant breakthroughs in autonomous driving and indoor applications, forestry applications are still lagging behind and new forest datasets would most certainly contribute to achieving significant progress in the development of data-driven methods for forest-like scenarios. This paper introduces a forest dataset called \textit{FinnWoodlands}, which consists of RGB stereo images, point clouds, and sparse depth maps, as well as ground truth manual annotations for semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. \textit{FinnWoodlands} comprises a total of 4226 objects manually annotated, out of which 2562 objects (60.6\%) correspond to tree trunks classified into three different instance categories, namely "Spruce Tree", "Birch Tree", and "Pine Tree". Besides tree trunks, we also annotated "Obstacles" objects as instances as well as the semantic stuff classes "Lake", "Ground", and "Track". Our dataset can be used in forestry applications where a holistic representation of the environment is relevant. We provide an initial benchmark using three models for instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and depth completion, and illustrate the challenges that such unstructured scenarios introduce.

                  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used to automate segmentation of organs-at-risk in radiotherapy. Since large sets of highly curated data are scarce, we investigated how much data is required to train accurate and robust head and neck auto-segmentation models. For this, an established 3D CNN was trained from scratch with different sized datasets (25-1000 scans) to segment the brainstem, parotid glands and spinal cord in CTs. Additionally, we evaluated multiple ensemble techniques to improve the performance of these models. The segmentations improved with training set size up to 250 scans and the ensemble methods significantly improved performance for all organs. The impact of the ensemble methods was most notable in the smallest datasets, demonstrating their potential for use in cases where large training datasets are difficult to obtain.

                  Language model probing is often used to test specific capabilities of these models. However, conclusions from such studies may be limited when the probing benchmarks are small and lack statistical power. In this work, we introduce new, larger datasets for negation (NEG-1500-SIMP) and role reversal (ROLE-1500) inspired by psycholinguistic studies. We dramatically extend existing NEG-136 and ROLE-88 benchmarks using GPT3, increasing their size from 18 and 44 sentence pairs to 750 each. We also create another version of extended negation dataset (NEG-1500-SIMP-TEMP), created using template-based generation. It consists of 770 sentence pairs. We evaluate 22 models on the extended datasets, seeing model performance dip 20-57% compared to the original smaller benchmarks. We observe high levels of negation sensitivity in models like BERT and ALBERT demonstrating that previous findings might have been skewed due to smaller test sets. Finally, we observe that while GPT3 has generated all the examples in ROLE-1500 is only able to solve 24.6% of them during probing.

                  We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a dedicated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our camera system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during training. We also propose a new model and a new training strategy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn representation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                  Extraction of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their semantic relations from unstructured text (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a fundamental work for software engineering tasks (e.g., API recommendation). However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning.

                  Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., "open door" and "open fridge", "walk upstairs" and "walk downstairs". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens ("open", "walk"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution ("open fridge", "walk upstairs") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.

                  Nearly all jurisdictions in the United States require a professional license exam, commonly referred to as "the Bar Exam," as a precondition for law practice. To even sit for the exam, most jurisdictions require that an applicant completes at least seven years of post-secondary education, including three years at an accredited law school. In addition, most test-takers also undergo weeks to months of further, exam-specific preparation. Despite this significant investment of time and capital, approximately one in five test-takers still score under the rate required to pass the exam on their first try. In the face of a complex task that requires such depth of knowledge, what, then, should we expect of the state of the art in "AI?" In this research, we document our experimental evaluation of the performance of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the exam. While we find no benefit in fine-tuning over GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance at the scale of our training data, we do find that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering positively impacted GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance. For best prompt and parameters, GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on a complete NCBE MBE practice exam, significantly in excess of the 25% baseline guessing rate, and performs at a passing rate for both Evidence and Torts. GPT-3.5's ranking of responses is also highly-correlated with correctness; its top two and top three choices are correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively, indicating very strong non-entailment performance. While our ability to interpret these results is limited by nascent scientific understanding of LLMs and the proprietary nature of GPT, we believe that these results strongly suggest that an LLM will pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.

                  Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to (i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are characterized by a single length-scale.

                  Recent methods demonstrate that data augmentation using counterfactual knowledge can teach models the causal structure of a task, leading to robust and generalizable models. However, such counterfactual data often has a limited scale and diversity if crowdsourced and is computationally expensive to extend to new perturbation types if generated using supervised methods. To address this, we introduce a new framework called DISCO for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters the generation to distill high-quality counterfactual data. We show that learning with this counterfactual data yields a comparatively small student model that is 6% (absolute) more robust and generalizes 5% better across distributions than baselines on various challenging evaluations. This model is also 15% more sensitive in differentiating original and counterfactual examples, on three evaluation sets written by human workers and via human-AI collaboration.

                  The physical mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains elusive. One of the difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple study addressing this question by making use of the "high-latitude emission" (HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature of HLE in the decaying phase of "broad pulses" of GRBs. We show that the HLE can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\nu}$ spectra and dominate the peak of $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectra even while the "line-of-sight emission" (LoSE) is still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this "HLE break" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity between the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three examples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We show that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\sim 10^{16}$ cm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and small-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a large emission radius.

                  Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex, now enable software developers to generate code based on a natural language prompt. Within computer science education, researchers are exploring the potential for LLMs to generate code explanations and programming assignments using carefully crafted prompts. These advances may enable students to interact with code in new ways while helping instructors scale their learning materials. However, LLMs also introduce new implications for academic integrity, curriculum design, and software engineering careers. This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs to help attendees evaluate whether and how LLMs might be integrated into their pedagogy and research. We will also engage attendees in brainstorming to consider how LLMs will impact our field.

                  The Brazilian test has been extremely popular while prompting significant debate. The main source of controversy is rooted in its indirect nature; the material tensile strength is inferred upon assuming that cracking initiates at the centre of the sample. Here, we use the Griffith criterion and finite element analysis to map the conditions (jaws geometry and material properties) that result in the nucleation of a centre crack. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict ourselves to evaluating the stress state at the disk centre; the failure envelope of the generalised Griffith criterion is used to establish the crack nucleation location. We find that the range of conditions where the Brazilian test is valid is much narrower than previously assumed, with current practices and standards being inappropriate for a wide range of rock-like materials. The results obtained are used to develop a protocol that experimentalists can follow to obtain a valid estimate of the material tensile strength. This is showcased with specific case studies and examples of valid and invalid tests from the literature. Furthermore, the uptake of this protocol is facilitated by providing a MATLAB App that determines the validity of the experiment for arbitrary test conditions.

                Erasure qubits: Overcoming the $T_1$ limit in superconducting circuits

                  The amplitude damping time, $T_1$, has long stood as the major factor limiting quantum fidelity in superconducting circuits, prompting concerted efforts in the material science and design of qubits aimed at increasing $T_1$. In contrast, the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, can usually be extended above $T_1$ (via, e.g., dynamical decoupling), to the point where it does not limit fidelity. In this article we propose a scheme for overcoming the conventional $T_1$ limit on fidelity by designing qubits in a way that amplitude damping errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors. Compared to standard qubit implementations our scheme improves the performance of fault-tolerant protocols, as numerically demonstrated by the circuit-noise simulations of the surface code. We describe two simple qubit implementations with superconducting circuits and discuss procedures for detecting amplitude damping errors, performing entangling gates, and extending $T_\phi$. Our results suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improving $T_\phi$ and the quality of quantum coherent control, as they effectively become the limiting factor on the performance of fault-tolerant protocols.

                On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos

                  Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these events. This is especially useful when, for instance, we cannot directly observe an electromagnetic counterpart, such as so-called "failed" GRB with hidden jets, or when light curve analysis is inconclusive.
