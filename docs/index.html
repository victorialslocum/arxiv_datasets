                  Self-supervised learning has been used to leverage unlabelled data, improving accuracy and generalisation of speech systems through the training of representation models. While many recent works have sought to produce effective representations across a variety of acoustic domains, languages, modalities and even simultaneous speakers, these studies have all been limited to single-channel audio recordings. This paper presents Spatial HuBERT, a self-supervised speech representation model that learns both acoustic and spatial information pertaining to a single speaker in a potentially noisy environment by using multi-channel audio inputs. Spatial HuBERT learns representations that outperform state-of-the-art single-channel speech representations on a variety of spatial downstream tasks, particularly in reverberant and noisy environments. We also demonstrate the utility of the representations learned by Spatial HuBERT on a speech localisation downstream task. Along with this paper, we publicly release a new dataset of 100 000 simulated first-order ambisonics room impulse responses.

                  While recent pre-trained transformer-based models can perform named entity recognition (NER) with great accuracy, their limited range remains an issue when applied to long documents such as whole novels. To alleviate this issue, a solution is to retrieve relevant context at the document level. Unfortunately, the lack of supervision for such a task means one has to settle for unsupervised approaches. Instead, we propose to generate a synthetic context retrieval training dataset using Alpaca, an instructiontuned large language model (LLM). Using this dataset, we train a neural context retriever based on a BERT model that is able to find relevant context for NER. We show that our method outperforms several retrieval baselines for the NER task on an English literary dataset composed of the first chapter of 40 books.

                  Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of glioblastoma patients due to its non-invasive and radiation-free nature. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge has contributed to generating numerous AI algorithms to accurately and efficiently segment glioblastoma sub-compartments using four structural (T1, T1Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR) MRI scans. However, these four MRI sequences may not always be available. To address this issue, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to synthesize the missing MRI sequences. In this paper, we implement and utilize an open-source GAN approach that takes any three MRI sequences as input to generate the missing fourth structural sequence. Our proposed approach is contributed to the community-driven generally nuanced deep learning framework (GaNDLF) and demonstrates promising results in synthesizing high-quality and realistic MRI sequences, enabling clinicians to improve their diagnostic capabilities and support the application of AI methods to brain tumor MRI quantification.

                  While recently developed NLP explainability methods let us open the black box in various ways (Madsen et al., 2022), a missing ingredient in this endeavor is an interactive tool offering a conversational interface. Such a dialogue system can help users explore datasets and models with explanations in a contextualized manner, e.g. via clarification or follow-up questions, and through a natural language interface. We adapt the conversational explanation framework TalkToModel (Slack et al., 2022) to the NLP domain, add new NLP-specific operations such as free-text rationalization, and illustrate its generalizability on three NLP tasks (dialogue act classification, question answering, hate speech detection). To recognize user queries for explanations, we evaluate fine-tuned and few-shot prompting models and implement a novel Adapter-based approach. We then conduct two user studies on (1) the perceived correctness and helpfulness of the dialogues, and (2) the simulatability, i.e. how objectively helpful dialogical explanations are for humans in figuring out the model's predicted label when it's not shown. We found rationalization and feature attribution were helpful in explaining the model behavior. Moreover, users could more reliably predict the model outcome based on an explanation dialogue rather than one-off explanations.

                  Data collection for forestry, timber, and agriculture currently relies on manual techniques which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. We seek to demonstrate that robotics offers improvements over these techniques and accelerate agricultural research, beginning with semantic segmentation and diameter estimation of trees in forests and orchards. We present TreeScope v1.0, the first robotics dataset for precision agriculture and forestry addressing the counting and mapping of trees in forestry and orchards. TreeScope provides LiDAR data from agricultural environments collected with robotics platforms, such as UAV and mobile robot platforms carried by vehicles and human operators. In the first release of this dataset, we provide ground-truth data with over 1,800 manually annotated semantic labels for tree stems and field-measured tree diameters. We share benchmark scripts for these tasks that researchers may use to evaluate the accuracy of their algorithms. Finally, we run our open-source diameter estimation and off-the-shelf semantic segmentation algorithms and share our baseline results.

                  The use of audio and visual modality for speaker localization has been well studied in the literature by exploiting their complementary characteristics. However, most previous works employ the setting of static sensors mounted at fixed positions. Unlike them, in this work, we explore the ego-centric setting, where the heterogeneous sensors are embodied and could be moving with a human to facilitate speaker localization. Compared to the static scenario, the ego-centric setting is more realistic for smart-home applications e.g., a service robot. However, this also brings new challenges such as blurred images, frequent speaker disappearance from the field of view of the wearer, and occlusions. In this paper, we study egocentric audio-visual speaker DOA estimation and deal with the challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based audio-visual fusion method to estimate the relative DOA of the speaker to the wearer, and design a training strategy to mitigate the problem of the speaker disappearing from the camera's view. We also develop a new dataset for simulating the out-of-view scenarios, by creating a scene with a camera wearer walking around while a speaker is moving at the same time. The experimental results show that our proposed method offers promising performance in this new dataset in terms of tracking accuracy. Finally, we adapt the proposed method for the multi-speaker scenario. Experiments on EasyCom show the effectiveness of the proposed model for multiple speakers in real scenarios, which achieves state-of-the-art results in the sphere active speaker detection task and the wearer activity prediction task. The simulated dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/KawhiZhao/Egocentric-Audio-Visual-Speaker-Localization.

                  In recent years, static meshes with texture maps have become one of the most prevalent digital representations of 3D shapes in various applications, such as animation, gaming, medical imaging, and cultural heritage applications. However, little research has been done on the quality assessment of textured meshes, which hinders the development of quality-oriented applications, such as mesh compression and enhancement. In this paper, we create a large-scale textured mesh quality assessment database, namely SJTU-TMQA, which includes 21 reference meshes and 945 distorted samples. The meshes are rendered into processed video sequences and then conduct subjective experiments to obtain mean opinion scores (MOS). The diversity of content and accuracy of MOS has been shown to validate its heterogeneity and reliability. The impact of various types of distortion on human perception is demonstrated. 13 state-of-the-art objective metrics are evaluated on SJTU-TMQA. The results report the highest correlation of around 0.6, indicating the need for more effective objective metrics. The SJTU-TMQA is available at https://ccccby.github.io

                  In this work we introduce the CitrusFarm dataset, a comprehensive multimodal sensory dataset collected by a wheeled mobile robot operating in agricultural fields. The dataset offers stereo RGB images with depth information, as well as monochrome, near-infrared and thermal images, presenting diverse spectral responses crucial for agricultural research. Furthermore, it provides a range of navigational sensor data encompassing wheel odometry, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GNSS with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) as the centimeter-level positioning ground truth. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected in three fields of citrus trees, featuring various tree species at different growth stages, distinctive planting patterns, as well as varying daylight conditions. It spans a total operation time of 1.7 hours, covers a distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 1.3 TB of data. We anticipate that this dataset can facilitate the development of autonomous robot systems operating in agricultural tree environments, especially for localization, mapping and crop monitoring tasks. Moreover, the rich sensing modalities offered in this dataset can also support research in a range of robotics and computer vision tasks, such as place recognition, scene understanding, object detection and segmentation, and multimodal learning. The dataset, in conjunction with related tools and resources, is made publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/Citrus-Farm-Dataset.

                  Understanding how machine learning models respond to distributional shifts is a key research challenge. Mazes serve as an excellent testbed due to varied generation algorithms offering a nuanced platform to simulate both subtle and pronounced distributional shifts. To enable systematic investigations of model behavior on out-of-distribution data, we present $\texttt{maze-dataset}$, a comprehensive library for generating, processing, and visualizing datasets consisting of maze-solving tasks. With this library, researchers can easily create datasets, having extensive control over the generation algorithm used, the parameters fed to the algorithm of choice, and the filters that generated mazes must satisfy. Furthermore, it supports multiple output formats, including rasterized and text-based, catering to convolutional neural networks and autoregressive transformer models. These formats, along with tools for visualizing and converting between them, ensure versatility and adaptability in research applications.

                  We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM) framework that generates rich and diverse NL datasets using only Vega-Lite specifications as input, thereby streamlining the development of Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data visualization. We propose two techniques to synthesize relevant chart semantics accurately and enhance syntactic diversity in each NL dataset, respectively: 1) a guided discovery incorporated into prompting so that LLMs can steer themselves to create varying NL datasets in a self-directed manner; 2) a score-based paraphrasing to augment NL syntax along with four well-defined language axes. We also present a new chart collection of 1,981 real-world Vega-Lite specifications that have increased diversity and complexity compared to benchmarks, to demonstrate the generalizability of our framework. The experimental results show that our framework accurately extracts chart semantics and generates L1/L2 captions with 89.4% and 76.0% accuracy, respectively, while generating and paraphrasing utterances and questions with greater diversity than benchmarks. The codes and chart collection are available at https://github.com/hyungkwonko/chart-llm.

                  Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive imaging technique that can reveal high-resolution retinal vessels. In this work, we propose an accurate and efficient neural network for retinal vessel segmentation in OCTA images. The proposed network achieves accuracy comparable to other SOTA methods, while having fewer parameters and faster inference speed (e.g. 110x lighter and 1.3x faster than U-Net), which is very friendly for industrial applications. This is achieved by applying the modified Recurrent ConvNeXt Block to a full resolution convolutional network. In addition, we create a new dataset containing 918 OCTA images and their corresponding vessel annotations. The data set is semi-automatically annotated with the help of Segment Anything Model (SAM), which greatly improves the annotation speed. For the benefit of the community, our code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/nhjydywd/OCTA-FRNet.

                  Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

                  The tasks of out-of-domain (OOD) intent discovery and generalized intent discovery (GID) aim to extend a closed intent classifier to open-world intent sets, which is crucial to task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. Previous methods address them by fine-tuning discriminative models. Recently, although some studies have been exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT to various downstream tasks, it is still unclear for the ability of ChatGPT to discover and incrementally extent OOD intents. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT on OOD intent discovery and GID, and then outline the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT exhibits consistent advantages under zero-shot settings, but is still at a disadvantage compared to fine-tuned models. More deeply, through a series of analytical experiments, we summarize and discuss the challenges faced by LLMs including clustering, domain-specific understanding, and cross-domain in-context learning scenarios. Finally, we provide empirical guidance for future directions to address these challenges.

                  Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with powerful general capabilities have been increasingly integrated into various Web applications, while undergoing alignment training to ensure that the generated content aligns with user intent and ethics. Unfortunately, they remain the risk of generating harmful content like hate speech and criminal activities in practical applications. Current approaches primarily rely on detecting, collecting, and training against harmful prompts to prevent such risks. However, they typically focused on the "superficial" harmful prompts with a solitary intent, ignoring composite attack instructions with multiple intentions that can easily elicit harmful content in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique for obfuscating harmful instructions: Compositional Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless intentions, making it impossible for the model to identify underlying malicious intentions. Furthermore, we implement two transformation methods, known as T-CIA and W-CIA, to automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing tasks, making them appear harmless to LLMs. We evaluated CIA on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and ChatGLM2 with two safety assessment datasets and two harmful prompt datasets. It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and 83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful prompt datasets. Our approach reveals the vulnerability of LLMs to such compositional instruction attacks that harbor underlying harmful intentions, contributing significantly to LLM security development.

                  Semantic and Cross-language code clone generation may be useful for code reuse, code comprehension, refactoring and benchmarking. OpenAI's GPT model has potential in such clone generation as GPT is used for text generation. When developers copy/paste codes from Stack Overflow (SO) or within a system, there might be inconsistent changes leading to unexpected behaviours. Similarly, if someone possesses a code snippet in a particular programming language but seeks equivalent functionality in a different language, a semantic cross-language code clone generation approach could provide valuable assistance.In this study, using SemanticCloneBench as a vehicle, we evaluated how well the GPT-3 model could help generate semantic and cross-language clone variants for a given fragment.We have comprised a diverse set of code fragments and assessed GPT-3s performance in generating code variants.Through extensive experimentation and analysis, where 9 judges spent 158 hours to validate, we investigate the model's ability to produce accurate and semantically correct variants. Our findings shed light on GPT-3's strengths in code generation, offering insights into the potential applications and challenges of using advanced language models in software development. Our quantitative analysis yields compelling results. In the realm of semantic clones, GPT-3 attains an impressive accuracy of 62.14% and 0.55 BLEU score, achieved through few-shot prompt engineering. Furthermore, the model shines in transcending linguistic confines, boasting an exceptional 91.25% accuracy in generating cross-language clones

                  This paper evaluates the extent to which current Large Language Models (LLMs) can capture task-oriented multi-party conversations (MPCs). We have recorded and transcribed 29 MPCs between patients, their companions, and a social robot in a hospital. We then annotated this corpus for multi-party goal-tracking and intent-slot recognition. People share goals, answer each other's goals, and provide other people's goals in MPCs - none of which occur in dyadic interactions. To understand user goals in MPCs, we compared three methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings: we fine-tuned T5, created pre-training tasks to train DialogLM using LED, and employed prompt engineering techniques with GPT-3.5-turbo, to determine which approach can complete this novel task with limited data. GPT-3.5-turbo significantly outperformed the others in a few-shot setting. The `reasoning' style prompt, when given 7% of the corpus as example annotated conversations, was the best performing method. It correctly annotated 62.32% of the goal tracking MPCs, and 69.57% of the intent-slot recognition MPCs. A `story' style prompt increased model hallucination, which could be detrimental if deployed in safety-critical settings. We conclude that multi-party conversations still challenge state-of-the-art LLMs.

                  We conduct the first empirical study on using knowledge transfer to improve the generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks, which often require LLMs to generalize beyond their training data. Our proposed general knowledge transfer approach guides the LLM towards a similar and familiar API or code snippet it has encountered before, improving the model's generalization ability for unseen knowledge. We apply this approach to three software engineering tasks: API inference, code example generation, and FQN inference, and find transfer span, transfer strategy, and transfer architecture as key factors affecting the method. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of knowledge transfer and its potential to enhance LLMs' performance in various software engineering tasks. The effectiveness of knowledge transfer varies depending on the target domain and task, with the hierarchical strategy being more effective than direct transfer, and AI-Chain outperforming CoT in prompt design. The implications of these findings extend beyond software engineering tasks and suggest that knowledge transfer can enhance LLMs' ability to handle unknowns in any natural language task.

                  Large scale language models (LLM) have received significant attention and found diverse applications across various domains, but their development encounters challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise due to the scarcity of public domain data availability and the need to maintain privacy with respect to private domain data. To address these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technology that enables collaborative training of shared models while preserving decentralized data. We propose the concept of federated LLM, which comprises three key components, i.e., federated LLM pre-training, federated LLM fine-tuning, and federated LLM prompt engineering. For each component, we discuss its advantage over traditional LLM training methods and propose specific engineering strategies for implementation. Furthermore, we explore the novel challenges introduced by the integration of FL and LLM. We analyze existing solutions and identify potential obstacles faced by these solutions within the context of federated LLM.

                  Recently, the release of INSTRUCTEVAL has provided valuable insights into the performance of large language models (LLMs) that utilize encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture. Interestingly, despite being introduced four years ago, T5-based LLMs, such as FLAN-T5, continue to outperform the latest decoder-based LLMs, such as LLAMA and VICUNA, on tasks that require general problem-solving skills. This performance discrepancy can be attributed to three key factors: (1) Pre-training data, (2) Backbone architecture, and (3) Instruction dataset. In this technical report, our main focus is on investigating the impact of the third factor by leveraging VICUNA, a large language model based on LLAMA, which has undergone fine-tuning on ChatGPT conversations. To achieve this objective, we fine-tuned VICUNA using a customized instruction dataset collection called FLANMINI. This collection includes a subset of the large-scale instruction dataset known as FLAN, as well as various code-related datasets and conversational datasets derived from ChatGPT/GPT-4. This dataset comprises a large number of tasks that demand problem-solving skills. Our experimental findings strongly indicate that the enhanced problem-solving abilities of our model, FLACUNA, are obtained through fine-tuning VICUNA on the FLAN dataset, leading to significant improvements across numerous benchmark datasets in INSTRUCTEVAL. FLACUNA is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flacuna-13b-v1.0.

                  This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified. A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly evolving field of content generation.

                  Knowledge graphs can represent information about the real-world using entities and their relations in a structured and semantically rich manner and they enable a variety of downstream applications such as question-answering, recommendation systems, semantic search, and advanced analytics. However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text.

                  Large language models (LLMs) have shown surprisingly good performance in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) even when trained without parallel data. Yet, despite the fact that the amount of training data is gigantic, they still struggle with translating rare words, particularly for low-resource languages. Even worse, it is usually unrealistic to retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning with low-resource languages on LLMs, which restricts the practical use of LLMs for translation -- how should we mitigate this problem? To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x ChrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set. We further demonstrate the importance of chaining the multilingual dictionaries, as well as the superiority of CoD to few-shot demonstration for low-resource languages.

                  The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).

                  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex, ChatGPT and GPT-4 have significantly impacted the AI community, including Text-to-SQL tasks. Some evaluations and analyses on LLMs show their potential to generate SQL queries but they point out poorly designed prompts (e.g. simplistic construction or random sampling) limit LLMs' performance and may cause unnecessary or irrelevant outputs. To address these issues, we propose CBR-ApSQL, a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)-based framework combined with GPT-3.5 for precise control over case-relevant and case-irrelevant knowledge in Text-to-SQL tasks. We design adaptive prompts for flexibly adjusting inputs for GPT-3.5, which involves (1) adaptively retrieving cases according to the question intention by de-semantizing the input question, and (2) an adaptive fallback mechanism to ensure the informativeness of the prompt, as well as the relevance between cases and the prompt. In the de-semanticization phase, we designed Semantic Domain Relevance Evaluator(SDRE), combined with Poincar\'e detector(mining implicit semantics in hyperbolic space), TextAlign(discovering explicit matches), and Positector (part-of-speech detector). SDRE semantically and syntactically generates in-context exemplar annotations for the new case. On the three cross-domain datasets, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) model in execution accuracy by 3.7\%, 2.5\%, and 8.2\%, respectively.
