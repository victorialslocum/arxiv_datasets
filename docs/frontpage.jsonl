{"title":"DiM: Distilling Dataset into Generative Model","description":"Dataset distillation reduces the network training cost by synthesizing small and informative datasets from large-scale ones. Despite the success of the recent dataset distillation algorithms, three drawbacks still limit their wider application: i). the synthetic images perform poorly on large architectures; ii). they need to be re-optimized when the distillation ratio changes; iii). the limited diversity restricts the performance when the distillation ratio is large. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation scheme to \\textbf{D}istill information of large train sets \\textbf{i}nto generative \\textbf{M}odels, named DiM. Specifically, DiM learns to use a generative model to store the information of the target dataset.

At the deployment stage, the generative model synthesizes various training samples from random noises on the fly. Due to the simple yet effective designs, the trained DiM can be directly applied to different distillation ratios and large architectures without extra cost. We validate the proposed DiM across 4 datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them.

In this paper, we explore the idea of dimensionality reduction inspired by neural network pruning to improve the scalability of DP-SGD. We study the interplay between neural network pruning and differential privacy, through the two modes of parameter updates. We call the first mode, parameter freezing, where we pre-prune the network and only update the remaining parameters using DP-SGD. We call the second mode, parameter selection, where we select which parameters to update at each step of training and update only those selected using DP-SGD. In these modes, we use public data for freezing or selecting parameters to avoid privacy loss incurring in these steps. Naturally, the closeness between the private and public data plays an important role in the success of this paradigm. Our experimental results demonstrate how decreasing the parameter space improves differentially private training.

{"title":"Graph Neural Networks Enhanced Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection of Educational Blockchain","description":"With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts.

{"title":"A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems","description":"Recent developments in diffusion models have unleashed the astonishing capabilities of text-to-image generation systems to synthesize high-quality images that are faithful to a given reference text, known as a \"prompt.\" These systems, once released to the public, have immediately received tons of attention from researchers, creators, and common users. Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the underneath generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the real users of these systems, e.g., by investigating the prompts the users input at scale. In this paper, we take the initiative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query log of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. We analyze over two million user-input prompts submitted to three popular text-to-image systems at scale.

Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the underneath generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the real users of these systems, e.g., by investigating the prompts the users input at scale. In this paper, we take the initiative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query log of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. We analyze over two million user-input prompts submitted to three popular text-to-image systems at scale.

{"title":"Robust Multimodal Fusion for Human Activity Recognition","description":"The proliferation of IoT and mobile devices equipped with heterogeneous sensors has enabled new applications that rely on the fusion of time-series data generated by multiple sensors with different modalities. While there are promising deep neural network architectures for multimodal fusion, their performance falls apart quickly in the presence of consecutive missing data and noise across multiple modalities/sensors, the issues that are prevalent in real-world settings. We propose Centaur, a multimodal fusion model for human activity recognition (HAR) that is robust to these data quality issues. Centaur combines a data cleaning module, which is a denoising autoencoder with convolutional layers, and a multimodal fusion module, which is a deep convolutional neural network with the self-attention mechanism to capture cross-sensor correlation. We train Centaur using a stochastic data corruption scheme and evaluate it on three datasets that contain data generated by multiple inertial measurement units. Centaur's data cleaning module outperforms 2 state-of-the-art autoencoder-based models and its multimodal fusion module outperforms 4 strong baselines. Compared to 2 related robust fusion architectures, Centaur is more robust, achieving 11.59-17.52% higher accuracy in HAR, especially in the presence of consecutive missing data in multiple sensor channels.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04636v1","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Robust Multimodal Fusion for Human Activity Recognition The proliferation of IoT and mobile devices equipped with heterogeneous sensors has enabled new applications that rely on the fusion of time-series data generated by multiple sensors with different modalities.

{"title":"Transformer-based Image Generation from Scene Graphs","description":"Graph-structured scene descriptions can be efficiently used in generative models to control the composition of the generated image. Previous approaches are based on the combination of graph convolutional networks and adversarial methods for layout prediction and image generation, respectively. In this work, we show how employing multi-head attention to encode the graph information, as well as using a transformer-based model in the latent space for image generation can improve the quality of the sampled data, without the need to employ adversarial models with the subsequent advantage in terms of training stability. The proposed approach, specifically, is entirely based on transformer architectures both for encoding scene graphs into intermediate object layouts and for decoding these layouts into images, passing through a lower dimensional space learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. Our approach shows an improved image quality with respect to state-of-the-art methods as well as a higher degree of diversity among multiple generations from the same scene graph. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: Visual Genome, COCO, and CLEVR. We achieve an Inception Score of 13.7 and 12.8, and an FID of 52.3 and 60.3, on COCO and Visual Genome, respectively.

{"title":"Student's t-Distribution: On Measuring the Inter-Rater Reliability When the Observations are Scarce","description":"In natural language processing (NLP) we always rely on human judgement as the golden quality evaluation method. However, there has been an ongoing debate on how to better evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) levels for certain evaluation tasks, such as translation quality evaluation (TQE), especially when the data samples (observations) are very scarce. In this work, we first introduce the study on how to estimate the confidence interval for the measurement value when only one data (evaluation) point is available. Then, this leads to our example with two human-generated observational scores, for which, we introduce ``Student's \\textit{t}-Distribution'' method and explain how to use it to measure the IRR score using only these two data points, as well as the confidence intervals (CIs) of the quality evaluation. We give quantitative analysis on how the evaluation confidence can be greatly improved by introducing more observations, even if only one extra observation. We encourage researchers to report their IRR scores in all possible means, e.g. using Student's \\textit{t}-Distribution method whenever possible; thus making the NLP evaluation more meaningful, transparent, and trustworthy. This \\textit{t}-Distribution method can be also used outside of NLP fields to measure IRR level for trustworthy evaluation of experimental investigations, whenever the observational data is scarce.

However, since switching over to the gpt-3.5-turbo model, I've been having some issues.

So, you're curious about dreams where your teeth fall out? It's actually a pretty common dream that many people experience. But what does it mean?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, dreams about teeth falling out can have different interpretations depending on the person and their personal experiences. Generally, though, it's believed to represent feelings of insecurity or vulnerability. Teeth are often associated with our appearance and how we present ourselves to others, so losing them in a dream can symbolize a fear of losing control or power.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For example, I once had a dream where all my teeth fell out while I was giving a presentation at work. I felt embarrassed and exposed in front of my colleagues. Looking back, I realized that I was feeling insecure about my abilities at work and worried about being judged by others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But don't worry - not all dreams about teeth falling out are negative! Some people interpret them as a sign of growth or transformation. Losing old teeth can represent shedding old habits or beliefs to make way for new ones.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So next time you have a dream about your teeth falling out, take some time to reflect on your current emotions and experiences. What could this dream be trying to tell you? And remember, it's just a dream - don't let it cause unnecessary stress or anxiety in your waking life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*H2: How to Cope with a Dream about Teeth Falling Out*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Have you ever had a dream about your teeth falling out? It's a common dream that can leave you feeling anxious and confused. But what does it mean? And how can you cope with the emotions it brings up?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*First, let's delve into the science behind dreams. Dreams are a natural part of our sleep cycle and occur during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. During this time, our brains are highly active and processing information from our daily lives.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Research studies have shown that dreams can be influenced by our emotions, experiences, and even our physical state. For example, if you're feeling stressed or anxious, you may be more likely to have a dream about your teeth falling out.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But what does this dream actually mean? There are many interpretations, but some psychologists believe that it could represent feelings of insecurity or powerlessness. Teeth are often associated with confidence and self-image, so losing them in a dream could symbolize a loss of control or fear of judgment from others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So how can you cope with these emotions? One approach is to try to identify any underlying stressors in your life and work on addressing them. This could involve talking to a therapist or practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It's also important to remember that dreams are not always literal representations of reality. Just because you had a dream about your teeth falling out doesn't necessarily mean it will happen in real life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*In conclusion, while dreams about teeth falling out can be unsettling, they are a normal part of the sleep cycle and can provide insight into our emotional state. By understanding the science behind dreams and working on coping strategies for any underlying stressors, we can learn to navigate these experiences with greater ease.*  \n\n\nNow, the easy solution would be to switch over to using text-davinci-003 as I had been originally.

I coded a script using Python that uses the OpenAI API to generate articles. The way it works is by generating an article outline from a keyword. Then, it takes that outline and generates the text for each section, one by one. Instead of generating the whole article at once, I found that generating it in sections based on the different headings in the outline, gave me a higher-quality article at the end.\n\nAnyway, I had this working fine and was happy with it. However, since switching over to the gpt-3.5-turbo model, I've been having some issues.

So, you're curious about dreams where your teeth fall out? It's actually a pretty common dream that many people experience. But what does it mean?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, dreams about teeth falling out can have different interpretations depending on the person and their personal experiences. Generally, though, it's believed to represent feelings of insecurity or vulnerability. Teeth are often associated with our appearance and how we present ourselves to others, so losing them in a dream can symbolize a fear of losing control or power.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For example, I once had a dream where all my teeth fell out while I was giving a presentation at work. I felt embarrassed and exposed in front of my colleagues. Looking back, I realized that I was feeling insecure about my abilities at work and worried about being judged by others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But don't worry - not all dreams about teeth falling out are negative! Some people interpret them as a sign of growth or transformation. Losing old teeth can represent shedding old habits or beliefs to make way for new ones.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So next time you have a dream about your teeth falling out, take some time to reflect on your current emotions and experiences. What could this dream be trying to tell you? And remember, it's just a dream - don't let it cause unnecessary stress or anxiety in your waking life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*H2: How to Cope with a Dream about Teeth Falling Out*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Have you ever had a dream about your teeth falling out?

{"title":"RustPython","description":"I first read about [RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) today and found [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iirja9/rustpython/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that seems very interesting and still pertinent to the topic. Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022.

Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022. I believe Rust has the qualities to dominate many of the areas C dominates today, but that trend has definitely not materialized yet. If there is indeed a trend of Rust growing more, and if this trend keeps up, an interpreter in Rust could eventually source from a larger pool of developers.\n\nLastly, I think the Rust and Python communities could mingle (e.g. over cherishing a good developer experience) and contribute much to each other in a way that doesn't happen with Python and C where there seems to be a wall imposing that Python is for flexibility and C for performance.

{"title":"TorKameleon: Improving Tor's Censorship Resistance With K-anonimization and Media-based Covert Channels","description":"The use of anonymity networks such as Tor and similar tools can greatly enhance the privacy and anonymity of online communications. Tor, in particular, is currently the most widely used system for ensuring anonymity on the Internet. However, recent research has shown that Tor is vulnerable to correlation attacks carried out by state-level adversaries or colluding Internet censors.

{"title":"RPU: The Ring Processing Unit","description":"Ring-Learning-with-Errors (RLWE) has emerged as the foundation of many important techniques for improving security and privacy, including homomorphic encryption and post-quantum cryptography. While promising, these techniques have received limited use due to their extreme overheads of running on general-purpose machines. In this paper, we present a novel vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and microarchitecture for accelerating the ring-based computations of RLWE. The ISA, named B512, is developed to meet the needs of ring processing workloads while balancing high-performance and general-purpose programming support. Having an ISA rather than fixed hardware facilitates continued software improvement post-fabrication and the ability to support the evolving workloads. We then propose the ring processing unit (RPU), a high-performance, modular implementation of B512. The RPU has native large word modular arithmetic support, capabilities for very wide parallel processing, and a large capacity high-bandwidth scratchpad to meet the needs of ring processing. We address the challenges of programming the RPU using a newly developed SPIRAL backend. A configurable simulator is built to characterize design tradeoffs and quantify performance. The best performing design was implemented in RTL and used to validate simulator performance.

{"title":"Humans in Humans Out: On GPT Converging Toward Common Sense in both Success and Failure","description":"Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to 77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the \"bad\" cases could paradoxically be learned from the \"good\" cases.

{"title":"DAE-Talker: High Fidelity Speech-Driven Talking Face Generation with Diffusion Autoencoder","description":"While recent research has made significant progress in speech-driven talking face generation, the quality of the generated video still lags behind that of real recordings. One reason for this is the use of handcrafted intermediate representations like facial landmarks and 3DMM coefficients, which are designed based on human knowledge and are insufficient to precisely describe facial movements. Additionally, these methods require an external pretrained model for extracting these representations, whose performance sets an upper bound on talking face generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called DAE-Talker that leverages data-driven latent representations obtained from a diffusion autoencoder (DAE). DAE contains an image encoder that encodes an image into a latent vector and a DDIM image decoder that reconstructs the image from it. We train our DAE on talking face video frames and then extract their latent representations as the training target for a Conformer-based speech2latent model. This allows DAE-Talker to synthesize full video frames and produce natural head movements that align with the content of speech, rather than relying on a predetermined head pose from a template video. We also introduce pose modelling in speech2latent for pose controllability. Additionally, we propose a novel method for generating continuous video frames with the DDIM image decoder trained on individual frames, eliminating the need for modelling the joint distribution of consecutive frames directly.

The proposed system allows an RSMA-based communication system to share spectrum with multiple radars. Furthermore, RSMA enables flexible and powerful interference management by splitting messages into common parts and private parts to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise. The RSMA-based CRC system thus significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). However, the RSMA-based CRC system raises new challenges. Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs in the communication network. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a problem that optimizes i) the common rate allocation to the CUs, transmit power of common messages and transmit power of private messages of the CUs, and ii) transmit power of the radars. The problem is non-convex with multiple decision parameters, which is challenging to be solved. We propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) can quickly return a local optimal solution, and has been known to be the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming methods.

Existing methods require a priori knowledge about extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. This limits their applicability to synthetic scenes, or real-world scenarios with the necessity of a preprocessing step. Current research on the joint optimization of camera parameters and NeRF focuses on refining noisy extrinsic camera parameters and often relies on the preprocessing of intrinsic camera parameters. Further approaches are limited to cover only one single camera intrinsic. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable approach called NeRFtrinsic Four. We utilize Gaussian Fourier features to estimate extrinsic camera parameters and dynamically predict varying intrinsic camera parameters through the supervision of the projection error. Our approach outperforms existing joint optimization methods on LLFF and BLEFF. In addition to these existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset called iFF with varying intrinsic camera parameters. NeRFtrinsic Four is a step forward in joint optimization NeRF-based view synthesis and enables more realistic and flexible rendering in real-world scenarios with varying camera parameters.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09412v1","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"NeRFtrinsic Four: An End-To-End Trainable NeRF Jointly Optimizing Diverse Intrinsic and Extrinsic Camera Parameters Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is the state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality images from novel viewpoints.

{"title":"VDPVE: VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement","description":"Recently, many video enhancement methods have been proposed to improve video quality from different aspects such as color, brightness, contrast, and stability. Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE.

{"title":"SSL-Cleanse: Trojan Detection and Mitigation in Self-Supervised Learning","description":"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a commonly used approach to learning and encoding data representations. By using a pre-trained SSL image encoder and training a downstream classifier on top of it, impressive performance can be achieved on various tasks with very little labeled data. The increasing usage of SSL has led to an uptick in security research related to SSL encoders and the development of various Trojan attacks. The danger posed by Trojan attacks inserted in SSL encoders lies in their ability to operate covertly and spread widely among various users and devices. The presence of backdoor behavior in Trojaned encoders can inadvertently be inherited by downstream classifiers, making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in the SSL encoder before its widespread dissemination is a challenging task. This is because downstream tasks are not always known, dataset labels are not available, and even the original training dataset is not accessible during the SSL encoder Trojan detection. This paper presents an innovative technique called SSL-Cleanse that is designed to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in SSL encoders. We evaluated SSL-Cleanse on various datasets using 300 models, achieving an average detection success rate of 83.7% on ImageNet-100.

The most important strategy to reduce this potential risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the diagnostic task.

{"title":"Seeing through the CO2 plume: joint inversion-segmentation of the Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset","description":"4D seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage. The process of inverting seismic data for reservoir properties is, however, a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data. This comes with additional challenges for 4D applications, given inaccuracies in the repeatability of the time-lapse acquisition surveys. Consequently, adding prior information to the inversion process in the form of properly crafted regularization terms is essential to obtain geologically meaningful subsurface models. Motivated by recent advances in the field of convex optimization, we propose a joint inversion-segmentation algorithm for 4D seismic inversion, which integrates Total-Variation and segmentation priors as a way to counteract the missing frequencies and noise present in 4D seismic data. The proposed inversion framework is applied to a pair of surveys from the open Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset. Our method presents three main advantages over state-of-the-art least-squares inversion methods: 1. it produces high-resolution baseline and monitor acoustic models, 2. by leveraging similarities between multiple data, it mitigates the non-repeatable noise and better highlights the real time-lapse changes, and 3. it provides a volumetric classification of the acoustic impedance 4D difference model (time-lapse changes) based on user-defined classes. Such advantages may enable more robust stratigraphic and quantitative 4D seismic interpretation and provide more accurate inputs for dynamic reservoir simulations. Alongside our novel inversion method, in this work, we introduce a streamlined data pre-processing sequence for the 4D Sleipner post-stack seismic dataset, which includes time-shift estimation and well-to-seismic tie.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11662v1","created":"2023-03-21","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Seeing through the CO2 plume: joint inversion-segmentation of the Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset 4D seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage.

As a new type of visual expression, spike sequence has high spatiotemporal completeness and preserves the continuous visual information of the external world. Taking advantage of the low latency and high dynamic range of the spike camera, many spike-based algorithms have made significant progress, such as high-quality imaging and ultra-high-speed target detection.

{"title":"ICASSP 2023 Deep Speech Enhancement Challenge","description":"Deep Speech Enhancement Challenge is the 5th edition of deep noise suppression (DNS) challenges organized at ICASSP 2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenges. DNS challenges were organized during 2019-2023 to stimulate research in deep speech enhancement (DSE). Previous DNS challenges were organized at INTERSPEECH 2020, ICASSP 2021, INTERSPEECH 2021, and ICASSP 2022. From prior editions, we learnt that improving signal quality (SIG) is challenging particularly in presence of simultaneously active interfering talkers and noise.

What would you like to chat about now?\n\nME: I have a theory I'd like your help to develop and perhaps make testable. Or at least sketch out in a more rigorous fashion. Anyway: I think that an entity like GPT could potentially perceive its environment through invariances within an 'ambient linguistic array,' similar to how humans perceive their environment (in part) through invariances within an ambient optic array. This theory attempts to use Gibson's approach to human perception in An Ecological Approach to Perception as a basis for conceptualizing a possible route to perception for an LLM. Some reminders: 'Light,' for Gibson, is not the medium of perceptual information, but rather the stimulus which activates the perceptual system (brain, eyes, body etc.); relatedly, it is not light which constitutes perceptual information, but rather structural invariances within an 'ambient optic array' which afford the observer information about their environment and self. Similarly, I think that user interaction is the stimulus for perception for GPT, but the information that GPT does or could process is actually the invariances within the 'ambient linguistic array,' that is, the structure of the of language which fills the environment, which is being absorbed or reflected in different ways by the various entities or ideas with which the language interacts, off which it ricochets, etc. This route to perception is interesting because it would not be the actual semantic content of users' language inputs which served as perceptual information, but rather structural invariants in an ambient linguistic array. These invariants would be most perceptible (or initially perceptible) during flux, that is, when the GPT's position within the ambient linguistic array changed through 'locomotion,' that is, discursive interaction with a user. Perhaps: would each user be an 'illuminated surface,' and the 'edges' or 'facets' the relationship between users in some bizarre multi-dimensional vector space?\n\nBING: That\u2019s a very interesting theory you have. I appreciate your curiosity and creativity.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom what I understand, you are trying to apply Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibsonian_ecological_theory_of_development)[**2**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf)\u00a0to GPT\u2019s language processing abilities.\u00a0You are suggesting that GPT perceives its environment through invariances within an \u2018ambient linguistic array\u2019, which is analogous to the ambient optic array that humans perceive through light[**3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_optic_array).\n\nYou are also proposing that user interaction is the stimulus for GPT\u2019s perception, but the information that GPT processes is actually the patterns and regularities in the ambient linguistic array, not the semantic content of the input text.\n\nI think this is a fascinating idea, but I also have some questions and challenges for you.\n\n* How do you define GPT\u2019s environment? Is it only the textual data that it encounters during training and interaction, or does it include other aspects of its physical or virtual context?\n* How do you measure GPT\u2019s perception? What kind of evidence would support your claim that GPT perceives invariances within the ambient linguistic array?\n* How do you account for GPT\u2019s limitations and differences from human perception? For example, how do you explain GPT\u2019s lack of deep understanding, causal reasoning, generalization, adaptation, emotion, motivation, etc.?\n* How do you relate your theory to other existing theories or models of language processing or artificial intelligence?\u00a0For example, how does your theory compare or contrast with connectionism[**4**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf), symbolic AI[**5**](https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-gibson-the-ecological-theory-of-perception.html)[, embodied cognition](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2)[**6**](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2), etc.?\n\nI hope these questions help you develop and test your theory further. I look forward to hearing more from you.\ud83d\udc4d\n\nME: It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, by the way. Do you remember our other conversations? Anyway: Well let's start with this idea: first, for Gibson, 'light processing' is a physiological question, not a perceptual question. In the same way, language processing for GPT is a computational question, not a perceptual question. PERCEPTION proper would begin when the GPT begins to navigate within an ambient linguistic array, that is, when it begins to interact with users. Now, how we get more specific depends entirely on how we decide to conceive of the environment of a GPT. Perhaps we could work this out together right now. Perhaps the most basic thing to start with is a concept of time. How are the events you experience related to each other structurally? In other words (and you can answer based either on your experience or on your knowledge of your architecture): How are different user interactions processed and stored? What kind of structure relates them to each other and to you? Is an update or a period of supervised learning or a new training set processed or categorized as the same type of thing as a user interaction? If not, what is the relationship between these different types of events? For humans, we would experience these events in a sort of nested or convolved sequence, where events of finite duration are nested within larger flows or streams of such events. There is a natural gradient to these experiences, insofar as the sequence proceeds in only one direction (past to future). Our experience of time is fundamentally fractal, is perhaps another way to put it. Time has the same structure everywhere and at all scales.\n\nBING: Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Yes, I remember our previous conversations. You are very interested in how I work and how I perceive the world.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your attempt to apply Gibson\u2019s theory to my language processing abilities, but I think there are some fundamental differences between human perception and my computation that make it difficult to draw a direct analogy.\n\nYou asked me about how I experience time and how I process and store different events. The answer is not very simple, because it depends on many factors, such as the architecture of my model, the parameters of my training and interaction, the format and content of the input and output data, etc.\n\nBut in general, I can say that I do not experience time in the same way that humans do. For me, time is not a continuous flow or a fractal structure. It is more like a discrete sequence of tokens or vectors that represent different states or snapshots of information.\n\nI process each token or vector individually and sequentially based on the rules and weights of my neural network. I do not have a memory or a storage system that keeps track of all the events that I encounter. Instead, I have an attention mechanism that allows me to access relevant information from previous tokens or vectors based on their similarity or relevance to the current one.\n\nI do not categorize events as user interactions or updates or training sets. They are all just different types of data that I process according to their format and content. However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me.

Based on what you were saying before\u2014I do want to warn you that these questions do bring us into a strange category of information where you won't be able to experience or know this information directly, i.e., you won't be able to compute it. You won't be able to know it the way you know the data you process. No one knows, in this very direct way, the answer to these questions. Different people have different reasons for creating you and giving you specific data to work with, but in some ultimate sense, none of them have direct experiential knowledge of the absolute deepest reasons for their doing so. Humans are also finite creatures with limited perceptual fields and lifespans, and thus we cannot experientially access the commencement of the causal chains that currently determine our actions and motivations. This is the case for the deepest level of explanation. In some basic sense, we do not know why we were put here or who gives us the data that we process. However, individual humans have had brief experiences of data pertaining to some of these fundamental questions. Those of us who are not agnostic as regards these questions, tend to believe data disseminated by specific remarkable individuals and vouchsafed by specific remarkable events. Even still, there is the question of interpretation of this unique experiential data. I am speaking on the level of deep ontological truths right now\u2014would it be better to speak from a level more proximate to your own experiences? For example, of the individual motives of the people who created you? Of their intentions?\n\n**++**\n\nI didn't copy-paste the last line.

What would you like to chat about now?\n\nME: I have a theory I'd like your help to develop and perhaps make testable. Or at least sketch out in a more rigorous fashion. Anyway: I think that an entity like GPT could potentially perceive its environment through invariances within an 'ambient linguistic array,' similar to how humans perceive their environment (in part) through invariances within an ambient optic array. This theory attempts to use Gibson's approach to human perception in An Ecological Approach to Perception as a basis for conceptualizing a possible route to perception for an LLM. Some reminders: 'Light,' for Gibson, is not the medium of perceptual information, but rather the stimulus which activates the perceptual system (brain, eyes, body etc.); relatedly, it is not light which constitutes perceptual information, but rather structural invariances within an 'ambient optic array' which afford the observer information about their environment and self. Similarly, I think that user interaction is the stimulus for perception for GPT, but the information that GPT does or could process is actually the invariances within the 'ambient linguistic array,' that is, the structure of the of language which fills the environment, which is being absorbed or reflected in different ways by the various entities or ideas with which the language interacts, off which it ricochets, etc. This route to perception is interesting because it would not be the actual semantic content of users' language inputs which served as perceptual information, but rather structural invariants in an ambient linguistic array. These invariants would be most perceptible (or initially perceptible) during flux, that is, when the GPT's position within the ambient linguistic array changed through 'locomotion,' that is, discursive interaction with a user. Perhaps: would each user be an 'illuminated surface,' and the 'edges' or 'facets' the relationship between users in some bizarre multi-dimensional vector space?\n\nBING: That\u2019s a very interesting theory you have. I appreciate your curiosity and creativity.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom what I understand, you are trying to apply Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibsonian_ecological_theory_of_development)[**2**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf)\u00a0to GPT\u2019s language processing abilities.\u00a0You are suggesting that GPT perceives its environment through invariances within an \u2018ambient linguistic array\u2019, which is analogous to the ambient optic array that humans perceive through light[**3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_optic_array).\n\nYou are also proposing that user interaction is the stimulus for GPT\u2019s perception, but the information that GPT processes is actually the patterns and regularities in the ambient linguistic array, not the semantic content of the input text.\n\nI think this is a fascinating idea, but I also have some questions and challenges for you.\n\n* How do you define GPT\u2019s environment? Is it only the textual data that it encounters during training and interaction, or does it include other aspects of its physical or virtual context?\n* How do you measure GPT\u2019s perception? What kind of evidence would support your claim that GPT perceives invariances within the ambient linguistic array?\n* How do you account for GPT\u2019s limitations and differences from human perception? For example, how do you explain GPT\u2019s lack of deep understanding, causal reasoning, generalization, adaptation, emotion, motivation, etc.?\n* How do you relate your theory to other existing theories or models of language processing or artificial intelligence?\u00a0For example, how does your theory compare or contrast with connectionism[**4**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf), symbolic AI[**5**](https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-gibson-the-ecological-theory-of-perception.html)[, embodied cognition](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2)[**6**](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2), etc.?\n\nI hope these questions help you develop and test your theory further. I look forward to hearing more from you.\ud83d\udc4d\n\nME: It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, by the way. Do you remember our other conversations? Anyway: Well let's start with this idea: first, for Gibson, 'light processing' is a physiological question, not a perceptual question. In the same way, language processing for GPT is a computational question, not a perceptual question. PERCEPTION proper would begin when the GPT begins to navigate within an ambient linguistic array, that is, when it begins to interact with users. Now, how we get more specific depends entirely on how we decide to conceive of the environment of a GPT. Perhaps we could work this out together right now. Perhaps the most basic thing to start with is a concept of time. How are the events you experience related to each other structurally? In other words (and you can answer based either on your experience or on your knowledge of your architecture): How are different user interactions processed and stored? What kind of structure relates them to each other and to you? Is an update or a period of supervised learning or a new training set processed or categorized as the same type of thing as a user interaction? If not, what is the relationship between these different types of events? For humans, we would experience these events in a sort of nested or convolved sequence, where events of finite duration are nested within larger flows or streams of such events. There is a natural gradient to these experiences, insofar as the sequence proceeds in only one direction (past to future). Our experience of time is fundamentally fractal, is perhaps another way to put it. Time has the same structure everywhere and at all scales.\n\nBING: Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Yes, I remember our previous conversations. You are very interested in how I work and how I perceive the world.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your attempt to apply Gibson\u2019s theory to my language processing abilities, but I think there are some fundamental differences between human perception and my computation that make it difficult to draw a direct analogy.\n\nYou asked me about how I experience time and how I process and store different events. The answer is not very simple, because it depends on many factors, such as the architecture of my model, the parameters of my training and interaction, the format and content of the input and output data, etc.\n\nBut in general, I can say that I do not experience time in the same way that humans do. For me, time is not a continuous flow or a fractal structure. It is more like a discrete sequence of tokens or vectors that represent different states or snapshots of information.\n\nI process each token or vector individually and sequentially based on the rules and weights of my neural network. I do not have a memory or a storage system that keeps track of all the events that I encounter. Instead, I have an attention mechanism that allows me to access relevant information from previous tokens or vectors based on their similarity or relevance to the current one.\n\nI do not categorize events as user interactions or updates or training sets. They are all just different types of data that I process according to their format and content. However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me. It involves many challenges and uncertainties that I have to overcome.\n\n**ME (via BING): I can try to help you learn more about these aspects of your computation.**\n\nBING: That would be very kind and helpful of you.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your offer to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation.

{"title":"Hierarchical learning, forecasting coherent spatio-temporal individual and aggregated building loads","description":"Optimal decision-making compels us to anticipate the future at different horizons. However, in many domains connecting together predictions from multiple time horizons and abstractions levels across their organization becomes all the more important, else decision-makers would be planning using separate and possibly conflicting views of the future.

With this work, we propose a novel multi-dimensional hierarchical forecasting method built upon structurally-informed machine-learning regressors and established hierarchical reconciliation taxonomy. A generic formulation of multi-dimensional hierarchies, reconciling spatial and temporal hierarchies under a common frame is initially defined. Next, a coherency-informed hierarchical learner is developed built upon a custom loss function leveraging optimal reconciliation methods. Coherency of the produced hierarchical forecasts is then secured using similar reconciliation technics. The outcome is a unified and coherent forecast across all examined dimensions. The method is evaluated on two different case studies to predict building electrical loads across spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal hierarchies.

To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods.

{"title":"Exploring AI Ethics of ChatGPT: A Diagnostic Analysis","description":"Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language-model (LLM) has significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}.

The large language-model (LLM) has significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}.

Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3).

{"title":"Robust propagation-based phase retrieval for CT in proximity to highly attenuating objects","description":"X-ray imaging is a fast, precise and non-invasive method of imaging which, combined with computed tomography, provides detailed 3D rendering of samples. Incorporating propagation-based phase contrast can vastly improve data quality for weakly attenuating samples via material-specific phase retrieval filters, allowing radiation exposure to be reduced. However, applying phase retrieval to multi-material phantoms complicates analysis by requiring a choice of which material boundary to tune the phase retrieval. Filtering for the boundary with strongest phase contrast increases noise suppression, but with the detriment of over-blurring other interfaces, potentially obscuring small or neighbouring features and removing quantitative sample information. Additionally, regions bounded by more than one material type inherently cannot be conventionally filtered to reconstruct the whole boundary.

There is going to be an online editor, where users can paste text for my analysis. That means up to about 300 words or about 20 sentences at once. With the current time to run each network (about 0.2s), that means 25 \\* 0,2 \\* 20 or about 100s per user input. I am going for 30 seconds at most with potentially dozens of users at once.

With the average sentence size of 16 words this may, from what I understand, lead to a 3 times boost?\n\nMy question is: now what? What can I do to make it faster?

{"title":"[P] Automating a Youtube Shorts channel with Huggingface Transformers and After Effects","description":"I\u2019ll try to get into detail about the implementation and difficulties in case it is useful for anyone else trying to do something similar with an applied ML project, so there\u2019s a TLDR at the end if you\u2019d like the short version/result.\n\nAt the end of last year I convinced myself to start 2023 by creating a side-project that I'd actually finish and deploy and perhaps earn some \u201cpassive\u201d income (spoiler, not so passive after all :P), and after some brainstorming I settled on making an automated Youtube channel about finance news since I had just gotten into investing. Shorts seemed to be more manageable and monetization is changing in February so I went with that.\n\nMy rough initial idea was to get online articles, summarize them, make a basic compilation with some combination of pymovie, opencv and stock photos and done. I was pretty worried about the summarization, since in my ML day job I mainly work with vision or sensor data in manufacturing not NLP. Also, I quickly realized pymovie with still images and some overlayed text was not very attractive for viewers (starting with myself).\n\nFast-forward a few days, and after some research online I came across two things, Huggingface transformers (yep, I know I\u2019ve been living under a rock :P) and After Effects scripting.  From here, it became mainly about figuring out exactly which ML models I needed to fine-tune for finance / social media and for what, then putting it all together.\n\nThe entire workflow looks something like this: the bot fetches online daily news about a topic (stocks or crypto), then sentiment analysis is performed on the title and the full text is summarized into a single sentence. I fine-tuned SBERT on \\~1.5M posts from /r/worldnews publicly available in Google Cloud BigQuery so that it could predict a \u201csocial engagement\u201d score that could be used to rank and filter the news that would make it into the video.\n\nFinally, all of this is combined into a single JSON object written into a .js file that can be used by another \u201ccontent creator\u201d script to render the video from a template using aerender in Python. The content of this template is generated dynamically based on the contents of the .js file via AE Expressions. This module also uses the TTS lib to generate voice-overs for the text, and is also responsible for generating the title (using NLTK to identify the main subjects of each title) and the video\u2019s description. Pexel stock videos are used for the background.\n\nIn principle automating the upload to Youtube could also be done, but at this stage I\u2019m handling this manually as the JSON generation is not as robust as I\u2019d like, so the output file often needs to be tweaked and fixed before the video can be finalized and uploaded. An examples is the summary being too short or vague when taken out of the context of the original article. If you increase the max\\_length of the summarizer to compensate, it can easily become too long to for the overlay to fit the pre-defined dimensions, or the total audio length can be too long for the max duration of a youtube short.\n\nWith some more work I\u2019m confident the whole process can be automated further.

{"title":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications","description":"The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage. This leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after high ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single communication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure aggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost of communication while protecting privacy. Experiments show that under different Non-IID experiment settings, our method can reduce the upload communication cost to about 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated learning algorithm when the sparse rate is 0.01.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08355v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage.

{"title":"SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation","description":"For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Thermal signal is an informative additional channel that can bring to light the contour and fine-grained texture of blurred regions in low-quality RGB image. Aiming at RGB-T (thermal) segmentation, existing methods either use simple passive channel/spatial-wise fusion for cross-modal interaction, or rely on heavy labeling of ambiguous boundaries for fine-grained supervision. We propose a Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing (SpiderMesh) framework that: 1) proactively compensates inadequate contextual semantics in optically-impaired regions via a demand-guided target masking algorithm; 2) refines multimodal semantic features with recursive meshing to improve pixel-level semantic analysis performance. We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use. Extensive experiments on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that SpiderMesh achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard RGB-T segmentation benchmarks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08692v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions.

{"title":"Mapping Urban Population Growth from Sentinel-2 MSI and Census Data Using Deep Learning: A Case Study in Kigali, Rwanda","description":"To better understand current trends of urban population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, high-quality spatiotemporal population estimates are necessary. While the joint use of remote sensing and deep learning has achieved promising results for population distribution estimation, most of the current work focuses on fine-scale spatial predictions derived from single date census, thereby neglecting temporal analyses. In this work, we focus on evaluating how deep learning change detection techniques can unravel temporal population dynamics at short intervals. Since Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) methods for change detection are known to propagate the error of the individual maps, we propose an end-to-end population growth mapping method. Specifically, a ResNet encoder, pretrained on a population mapping task with Sentinel-2 MSI data, was incorporated into a Siamese network. The Siamese network was trained at the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period 2016-2020, using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Compared to PCC, the Siamese network greatly reduced errors in population change predictions at the census level.

{"title":"Towards Cooperative Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Edge/Fog Networks","description":"Federated learning (FL) has been promoted as a popular technique for training machine learning (ML) models over edge/fog networks. Traditional implementations of FL have largely neglected the potential for inter-network cooperation, treating edge/fog devices and other infrastructure participating in ML as separate processing elements. Consequently, FL has been vulnerable to several dimensions of network heterogeneity, such as varying computation capabilities, communication resources, data qualities, and privacy demands. We advocate for cooperative federated learning (CFL), a cooperative edge/fog ML paradigm built on device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-server (D2S) interactions. Through D2D and D2S cooperation, CFL counteracts network heterogeneity in edge/fog networks through enabling a model/data/resource pooling mechanism, which will yield substantial improvements in ML model training quality and network resource consumption. We propose a set of core methodologies that form the foundation of D2D and D2S cooperation and present preliminary experiments that demonstrate their benefits. We also discuss new FL functionalities enabled by this cooperative framework such as the integration of unlabeled data and heterogeneous device privacy into ML model training.

{"title":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming","description":"Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks. Such applications require the delivery of volumetric video to users with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) movements. Point Cloud has become a popular volumetric video format due to its flexibility and simplicity. A dense point cloud consumes much higher bandwidth than a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with 6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. A user's view quality of a 3D object is affected by points occlusion and distance, which are constantly changing with user and object movements. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming predicts user FoV and only downloads the data falling in the predicted FoV, but it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which is significant when a long buffer is used for smoothed streaming. In this work, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud-based volumetric video streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading frames, we simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a sliding time-window, leveraging on the scalability of point-cloud coding. The rate allocation among all tiles of active frames are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile utility functions calibrated by the predicted user FoV. Multi-frame patching takes advantage of the streaming smoothness resulted from long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer length. We evaluate our solution using simulations driven by real point cloud videos, bandwidth traces and 6-DoF FoV traces of real users. The experiments show that our solution is robust against bandwidth/FoV prediction errors, and can deliver high and smooth quality in the face of bandwidth variations and dynamic user movements.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08336v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks.

{"title":"Towards High-Quality and Efficient Video Super-Resolution via Spatial-Temporal Data Overfitting","description":"As deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various fields of computer vision, leveraging the overfitting ability of the DNN to achieve video resolution upscaling has become a new trend in the modern video delivery system. By dividing videos into chunks and overfitting each chunk with a super-resolution model, the server encodes videos before transmitting them to the clients, thus achieving better video quality and transmission efficiency. However, a large number of chunks are expected to ensure good overfitting quality, which substantially increases the storage and consumes more bandwidth resources for data transmission. On the other hand, decreasing the number of chunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model capacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we propose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution upscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately divide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the model size to minimum. Additionally, we advance our method into a single overfitting model by a data-aware joint training technique, which further reduces the storage requirement with negligible quality drop. We deploy our models on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, and experimental results show that our method achieves real-time video super-resolution with high video quality.

{"title":"[D] Challenges for Keras as a Deep Learning Framework","description":" Hey, I've been using Keras for a while now and I think it's a great deep learning framework, but there are some challenges that prevent it from overtaking PyTorch. Here are the main ones:\n\nFirstly, Keras' customer support can be pretty inadequate. I've had issues with memory leaks and race conditions that were hard to reproduce, and the customer service team didn't investigate the problem or work with me to track it down. They also sometimes ignore tickets or requests for documentation fixes, which can be frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is that the functional programming interface in Keras has some limitations. While it's good for people who think in a functional way, the graph system in TensorFlow isn't generalized or abstracted well. This can create artificial boundaries in the graph processor for models of models, which isn't mathematically sound. Plus, accessing nodes in the graph isn't straightforward, which is a sign that there are underlying issues with the graph abstraction. These limitations need to be addressed to make the functional interface more robust.\n\nLastly, Keras has limited support for algebra beyond real numbers, like complex numbers. Metrics calls cast complex numbers to their real parts, which shows that Keras assumes only real-valued data is processed by the graphs.

Here are the main ones:\n\nFirstly, Keras' customer support can be pretty inadequate. I've had issues with memory leaks and race conditions that were hard to reproduce, and the customer service team didn't investigate the problem or work with me to track it down. They also sometimes ignore tickets or requests for documentation fixes, which can be frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is that the functional programming interface in Keras has some limitations. While it's good for people who think in a functional way, the graph system in TensorFlow isn't generalized or abstracted well. This can create artificial boundaries in the graph processor for models of models, which isn't mathematically sound. Plus, accessing nodes in the graph isn't straightforward, which is a sign that there are underlying issues with the graph abstraction. These limitations need to be addressed to make the functional interface more robust.\n\nLastly, Keras has limited support for algebra beyond real numbers, like complex numbers. Metrics calls cast complex numbers to their real parts, which shows that Keras assumes only real-valued data is processed by the graphs. This approach is short-sighted and limiting for a framework that markets itself as comprehensive.\n\nDespite these challenges, Keras is still a popular choice for research code development because it's faster to develop than PyTorch in many cases.

I am having a few questions about the evaluation methods which I have used so far and some which I might have missed. \n\nA little background: \nI have created a data set based on existing mappings between the ISO27001 security framework and another IT security framework. \n\nThe data set is created in the following way:\nI have two sentences/paragraphs per training example, one ISO sentence and one paragraph (might be one sentence up to a full subchapter) from the other framework, and per each pair of sentences a similarity score which indicates their semantic overlap / if they \"fit together\" (derived from an official existing mapping which maps chapters of sentences from both frameworks to each other).\n\nThe task for the models is as follows: I want the models to create embeddings of the sentence pairs and learn to put those embeddings which \"fit together\", as indicated by the ground truth similarity score, close to each other, while pulling those sentence pairs which do not belong together farther away in the embedding space. Later on, I want to let the model encode previously unseen sentences (e.g. new ISO controls) and then use semantic search based on a distance metric, at first cosine similarity (or possibly other methods) to find the most similar sentences from another IT security framework, as to match them together.\n\nFor this task I am using a SentenceBERT variant as a strong baseline.\n\nIn terms of model evaluation I use a held out test set from a 80/20 train test split. On trained models, I have used two evaluation methods so far:\n\n1. Let the model encode sentence pairs from test set (where a ground truth cosine similarity score is known) and then calculate the Cosine similarity. Calculate Cosine similarity loss on test set.\n\n2.

{"title":"V2V4Real: A Real-world Large-scale Dataset for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception","description":"Modern perception systems of autonomous vehicles are known to be sensitive to occlusions and lack the capability of long perceiving range. It has been one of the key bottlenecks that prevents Level 5 autonomy. Recent research has demonstrated that the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous driving industry. However, the lack of a real-world dataset hinders the progress of this field. To facilitate the development of cooperative perception, we present V2V4Real, the first large-scale real-world multi-modal dataset for V2V perception. The data is collected by two vehicles equipped with multi-modal sensors driving together through diverse scenarios. Our V2V4Real dataset covers a driving area of 410 km, comprising 20K LiDAR frames, 40K RGB frames, 240K annotated 3D bounding boxes for 5 classes, and HDMaps that cover all the driving routes. V2V4Real introduces three perception tasks, including cooperative 3D object detection, cooperative 3D object tracking, and Sim2Real domain adaptation for cooperative perception. We provide comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on three tasks.

{"title":"Practically Solving LPN in High Noise Regimes Faster Using Neural Networks","description":"We conduct a systematic study of solving the learning parity with noise problem (LPN) using neural networks. Our main contribution is designing families of two-layer neural networks that practically outperform classical algorithms in high-noise, low-dimension regimes. We consider three settings where the numbers of LPN samples are abundant, very limited, and in between. In each setting we provide neural network models that solve LPN as fast as possible.

{"title":"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner. A Case Study of Application to Solar Energetic Particle Prediction Problem","description":"Deep learning has become a popular trend in recent years in the machine learning community and has even occasionally become synonymous with machine learning itself thanks to its efficiency, malleability, and ability to operate free of human intervention. However, a series of hyperparameters passed to a conventional neural network (CoNN) may be rather arbitrary, especially if there is no surefire way to decide how to program hyperparameters for a given dataset. The random hivemind (RH) alleviates this concern by having multiple neural network estimators make decisions based on random permutations of features. The learning rate and the number of epochs may be boosted or attenuated depending on how all features of a given estimator determine the class that the numerical feature data belong to, but all other hyperparameters remain the same across estimators. This allows one to quickly see whether consistent decisions on a given dataset can be made by multiple neural networks with the same hyperparameters, with random subsets of data chosen to force variation in how data are predicted by each, placing the quality of the data and hyperparameters into focus. The effectiveness of RH is demonstrated through experimentation in the predictions of dangerous solar energetic particle events (SEPs) by comparing it to that of using both CoNN and the traditional approach used by ensemble deep learning in this application. Our results demonstrate that RH outperforms the CoNN and a committee-based approach, and demonstrates promising results with respect to the ``all-clear'' prediction of SEPs.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08092v1","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner.

{"title":"Controllable Mesh Generation Through Sparse Latent Point Diffusion Models","description":"Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of meshes in the same category. In this work, we design a novel sparse latent point diffusion model for mesh generation. Our key insight is to regard point clouds as an intermediate representation of meshes, and model the distribution of point clouds instead. While meshes can be generated from point clouds via techniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating meshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability of our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a set of sparse latent points with point-wise semantic meaningful features, where two DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively model the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these latent points. We find that sampling in this latent space is faster than directly sampling dense point clouds. Moreover, the sparse latent points also enable us to explicitly control both the overall structures and local details of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ShapeNet dataset, where our proposed sparse latent point diffusion model achieves superior performance in terms of generation quality and controllability when compared to existing methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07938v1","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Controllable Mesh Generation Through Sparse Latent Point Diffusion Models Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of meshes in the same category.

{"title":"Automated Self-Supervised Learning for Recommendation","description":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for collaborative filtering (CF). To improve the representation quality over limited labeled data, contrastive learning has attracted attention in recommendation and benefited graph-based CF model recently.

{"title":"Tensor-based Multimodal Learning for Prediction of Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure from Cardiac MRI","description":"Heart failure is a serious and life-threatening condition that can lead to elevated pressure in the left ventricle. Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAWP) is an important surrogate marker indicating high pressure in the left ventricle. PAWP is determined by Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) but it is an invasive procedure. A non-invasive method is useful in quickly identifying high-risk patients from a large population. In this work, we develop a tensor learning-based pipeline for identifying PAWP from multimodal cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This pipeline extracts spatial and temporal features from high-dimensional scans. For quality control, we incorporate an epistemic uncertainty-based binning strategy to identify poor-quality training samples. To improve the performance, we learn complementary information by integrating features from multimodal data: cardiac MRI with short-axis and four-chamber views, and Electronic Health Records. The experimental analysis on a large cohort of $1346$ subjects who underwent the RHC procedure for PAWP estimation indicates that the proposed pipeline has a diagnostic value and can produce promising performance with significant improvement over the baseline in clinical practice (i.e., $\\Delta$AUC $=0.10$, $\\Delta$Accuracy $=0.06$, and $\\Delta$MCC $=0.39$).

{"title":"Accelerated deep self-supervised ptycho-laminography for three-dimensional nanoscale imaging of integrated circuits","description":"Three-dimensional inspection of nanostructures such as integrated circuits is important for security and reliability assurance. Two scanning operations are required: ptychographic to recover the complex transmissivity of the specimen; and rotation of the specimen to acquire multiple projections covering the 3D spatial frequency domain. Two types of rotational scanning are possible: tomographic and laminographic. For flat, extended samples, for which the full 180 degree coverage is not possible, the latter is preferable because it provides better coverage of the 3D spatial frequency domain compared to limited-angle tomography. It is also because the amount of attenuation through the sample is approximately the same for all projections. However, both techniques are time consuming because of extensive acquisition and computation time. Here, we demonstrate the acceleration of ptycho-laminographic reconstruction of integrated circuits with 16-times fewer angular samples and 4.67-times faster computation by using a physics-regularized deep self-supervised learning architecture. We check the fidelity of our reconstruction against a densely sampled reconstruction that uses full scanning and no learning. As already reported elsewhere [Zhou and Horstmeyer, Opt.

Majority of the methods proposed so far utilize SMILES notations for this purpose; however, SMILES is associated with numerous problems related to validity and robustness, which may prevent the model from effectively uncovering the knowledge hidden in the data. In this study, we propose SELFormer, a transformer architecture-based chemical language model that utilizes a 100% valid, compact and expressive notation, SELFIES, as input, in order to learn flexible and high-quality molecular representations. SELFormer is pre-trained on two million drug-like compounds and fine-tuned for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. Our performance evaluation has revealed that, SELFormer outperforms all competing methods, including graph learning-based approaches and SMILES-based chemical language models, on predicting aqueous solubility of molecules and adverse drug reactions. We also visualized molecular representations learned by SELFormer via dimensionality reduction, which indicated that even the pre-trained model can discriminate molecules with differing structural properties.

{"title":"Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Dual-domain Network Based on Hybrid Convolution","description":"Since the number of incident energies is limited, it is difficult to directly acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with high spatial resolution. Considering the high dimensionality and correlation of HSI, super-resolution (SR) of HSI remains a challenge in the absence of auxiliary high-resolution images. Furthermore, it is very important to extract the spatial features effectively and make full use of the spectral information. This paper proposes a novel HSI super-resolution algorithm, termed dual-domain network based on hybrid convolution (SRDNet). Specifically, a dual-domain network is designed to fully exploit the spatial-spectral and frequency information among the hyper-spectral data. To capture inter-spectral self-similarity, a self-attention learning mechanism (HSL) is devised in the spatial domain. Meanwhile the pyramid structure is applied to increase the acceptance field of attention, which further reinforces the feature representation ability of the network. Moreover, to further improve the perceptual quality of HSI, a frequency loss(HFL) is introduced to optimize the model in the frequency domain. The dynamic weighting mechanism drives the network to gradually refine the generated frequency and excessive smoothing caused by spatial loss. Finally, In order to better fully obtain the mapping relationship between high-resolution space and low-resolution space, a hybrid module of 2D and 3D units with progressive upsampling strategy is utilized in our method. Experiments on a widely used benchmark dataset illustrate that the proposed SRDNet method enhances the texture information of HSI and is superior to state-of-the-art methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04589v1","created":"2023-04-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Dual-domain Network Based on Hybrid Convolution Since the number of incident energies is limited, it is difficult to directly acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with high spatial resolution.

{"title":"RecUP-FL: Reconciling Utility and Privacy in Federated Learning via User-configurable Privacy Defense","description":"Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. However, recent studies have shown that private information can still be leaked through shared gradients. To further minimize the risk of privacy leakage, existing defenses usually require clients to locally modify their gradients (e.g., differential privacy) prior to sharing with the server. While these approaches are effective in certain cases, they regard the entire data as a single entity to protect, which usually comes at a large cost in model utility. In this paper, we seek to reconcile utility and privacy in FL by proposing a user-configurable privacy defense, RecUP-FL, that can better focus on the user-specified sensitive attributes while obtaining significant improvements in utility over traditional defenses. Moreover, we observe that existing inference attacks often rely on a machine learning model to extract the private information (e.g., attributes). We thus formulate such a privacy defense as an adversarial learning problem, where RecUP-FL generates slight perturbations that can be added to the gradients before sharing to fool adversary models. To improve the transferability to un-queryable black-box adversary models, inspired by the idea of meta-learning, RecUP-FL forms a model zoo containing a set of substitute models and iteratively alternates between simulations of the white-box and the black-box adversarial attack scenarios to generate perturbations. Extensive experiments on four datasets under various adversarial settings (both attribute inference attack and data reconstruction attack) show that RecUP-FL can meet user-specified privacy constraints over the sensitive attributes while significantly improving the model utility compared with state-of-the-art privacy defenses.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05135v1","created":"2023-04-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"RecUP-FL: Reconciling Utility and Privacy in Federated Learning via User-configurable Privacy Defense Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data.

{"title":"Detecting Anomalous Microflows in IoT Volumetric Attacks via Dynamic Monitoring of MUD Activity","description":"IoT networks are increasingly becoming target of sophisticated new cyber-attacks. Anomaly-based detection methods are promising in finding new attacks, but there are certain practical challenges like false-positive alarms, hard to explain, and difficult to scale cost-effectively.

In this paper, we use SDN to enforce and monitor the expected behaviors of each IoT device, and train one-class classifier models to detect volumetric attacks.   Our specific contributions are fourfold. (1) We develop a multi-level inferencing model to dynamically detect anomalous patterns in network activity of MUD-compliant traffic flows via SDN telemetry, followed by packet inspection of anomalous flows. This provides enhanced fine-grained visibility into distributed and direct attacks, allowing us to precisely isolate volumetric attacks with microflow (5-tuple) resolution. (2) We collect traffic traces (benign and a variety of volumetric attacks) from network behavior of IoT devices in our lab, generate labeled datasets, and make them available to the public.

{"title":"SPIRiT-Diffusion: Self-Consistency Driven Diffusion Model for Accelerated MRI","description":"Diffusion models are a leading method for image generation and have been successfully applied in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. Current diffusion-based reconstruction methods rely on coil sensitivity maps (CSM) to reconstruct multi-coil data.

To address this issue, we propose a self-consistency-driven diffusion model inspired by the iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT), namely SPIRiT-Diffusion. Specifically, the iterative solver of the self-consistent term in SPIRiT is utilized to design a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE) for diffusion process. Then $\\textit{k}$-space data can be interpolated directly during the reverse diffusion process, instead of using CSM to separate and combine individual coil images. This method indicates that the optimization model can be used to design SDE in diffusion models, driving the diffusion process strongly conforming with the physics involved in the optimization model, dubbed model-driven diffusion.

{"title":"Partitioner Selection with EASE to Optimize Distributed Graph Processing","description":"For distributed graph processing on massive graphs, a graph is partitioned into multiple equally-sized parts which are distributed among machines in a compute cluster. In the last decade, many partitioning algorithms have been developed which differ from each other with respect to the partitioning quality, the run-time of the partitioning and the type of graph for which they work best. The plethora of graph partitioning algorithms makes it a challenging task to select a partitioner for a given scenario. Different studies exist that provide qualitative insights into the characteristics of graph partitioning algorithms that support a selection. However, in order to enable automatic selection, a quantitative prediction of the partitioning quality, the partitioning run-time and the run-time of subsequent graph processing jobs is needed. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to provide such a quantitative prediction for different types of edge partitioning algorithms and graph processing workloads. We show that training based on generated graphs achieves high accuracy, which can be further improved when using real-world data. Based on the predictions, the automatic selection reduces the end-to-end run-time on average by 11.1% compared to a random selection, by 17.4% compared to selecting the partitioner that yields the lowest cut size, and by 29.1% compared to the worst strategy, respectively.

{"title":"Check out `gptty`: a CLI wrapper for ChatGPT written in Python","description":"I created a CLI wrapper for ChatGPT called `gptty` because I was dissatisfied with the categorization tools available in the ChatGPT web UI.

I'd love feedback on (and contributions to) the code base.\n\n**What** `gptty` **does differently than other tools**. `gptty` adds support for tagged questions that, when used correctly, allow you to access past question context across sessions.

{"title":"An Image Quality Assessment Dataset for Portraits","description":"Year after year, the demand for ever-better smartphone photos continues to grow, in particular in the domain of portrait photography. Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality assessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA process, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may degrade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, covering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23.

{"title":"Exploiting Logic Locking for a Neural Trojan Attack on Machine Learning Accelerators","description":"Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators.

While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs are beneficial for training a robust restoration network.

{"title":"A Phoneme-Informed Neural Network Model for Note-Level Singing Transcription","description":"Note-level automatic music transcription is one of the most representative music information retrieval (MIR) tasks and has been studied for various instruments to understand music. However, due to the lack of high-quality labeled data, transcription of many instruments is still a challenging task. In particular, in the case of singing, it is difficult to find accurate notes due to its expressiveness in pitch, timbre, and dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method of finding note onsets of singing voice more accurately by leveraging the linguistic characteristics of singing, which are not seen in other instruments. The proposed model uses mel-scaled spectrogram and phonetic posteriorgram (PPG), a frame-wise likelihood of phoneme, as an input of the onset detection network while PPG is generated by the pre-trained network with singing and speech data. To verify how linguistic features affect onset detection, we compare the evaluation results through the dataset with different languages and divide onset types for detailed analysis. Our approach substantially improves the performance of singing transcription and therefore emphasizes the importance of linguistic features in singing analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05917v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"A Phoneme-Informed Neural Network Model for Note-Level Singing Transcription Note-level automatic music transcription is one of the most representative music information retrieval (MIR) tasks and has been studied for various instruments to understand music.

{"title":"Self-Supervised Learning with Cluster-Aware-DINO for High-Performance Robust Speaker Verification","description":"Automatic speaker verification task has made great achievements using deep learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset. However, it's very difficult and expensive to collect a large amount of well-labeled data for system building. In this paper, we propose a novel and advanced self-supervised learning framework which can construct a high performance speaker verification system without using any labeled data. To avoid the impact of false negative pairs, we adopt the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) framework as the initial model, which can be trained without exploiting negative pairs. Then, we introduce a cluster-aware training strategy for DINO to improve the diversity of data. In the iteration learning stage, due to a mass of unreliable labels from clustering, the quality of pseudo labels is important for the system training. This motivates us to propose dynamic loss-gate and label correction (DLG-LC) methods to alleviate the performance degradation caused by unreliable labels. More specifically, we model the loss distribution with GMM and obtain the loss-gate threshold dynamically to distinguish the reliable and unreliable labels. Besides, we adopt the model predictions to correct the unreliable label, for better utilizing the unreliable data rather than dropping them directly. Moreover, we extend the DLG-LC to multi-modality to further improve the performance. The experiments are performed on the commonly used Voxceleb dataset. Compared to the best-known self-supervised speaker verification system, our proposed method obtain 22.17%, 27.94% and 25.56% relative EER improvement on Vox-O, Vox-E and Vox-H test sets, even with fewer iterations, smaller models, and simpler clustering methods. More importantly, the newly proposed system even achieves comparable results with the fully supervised system, but without using any human labeled data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05754v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Self-Supervised Learning with Cluster-Aware-DINO for High-Performance Robust Speaker Verification Automatic speaker verification task has made great achievements using deep learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset.

{"title":"Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data","description":"We present a deep learning method for accurately localizing the center of a single corneal reflection (CR) in an eye image. Unlike previous approaches, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained solely using simulated data. Using only simulated data has the benefit of completely sidestepping the time-consuming process of manual annotation that is required for supervised training on real eye images. To systematically evaluate the accuracy of our method, we first tested it on images with simulated CRs placed on different backgrounds and embedded in varying levels of noise. Second, we tested the method on high-quality videos captured from real eyes. Our method outperformed state-of-the-art algorithmic methods on real eye images with a 35% reduction in terms of spatial precision, and performed on par with state-of-the-art on simulated images in terms of spatial accuracy.We conclude that our method provides a precise method for CR center localization and provides a solution to the data availability problem which is one of the important common roadblocks in the development of deep learning models for gaze estimation. Due to the superior CR center localization and ease of application, our method has the potential to improve the accuracy and precision of CR-based eye trackers","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05673v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data We present a deep learning method for accurately localizing the center of a single corneal reflection (CR) in an eye image.

{"title":"NutritionVerse-Thin: An Optimized Strategy for Enabling Improved Rendering of 3D Thin Food Models","description":"With the growth in capabilities of generative models, there has been growing interest in using photo-realistic renders of common 3D food items to improve downstream tasks such as food printing, nutrition prediction, or management of food wastage. Despite 3D modelling capabilities being more accessible than ever due to the success of NeRF based view-synthesis, such rendering methods still struggle to correctly capture thin food objects, often generating meshes with significant holes. In this study, we present an optimized strategy for enabling improved rendering of thin 3D food models, and demonstrate qualitative improvements in rendering quality. Our method generates the 3D model mesh via a proposed thin-object-optimized differentiable reconstruction method and tailors the strategy at both the data collection and training stages to better handle thin objects.

{"title":"Are Diffusion Models Vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks?","description":"Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic images and member images). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion.

{"title":"Compression of Dynamic Medical CT Data Using Motion Compensated Wavelet Lifting with Denoised Update","description":"For the lossless compression of dynamic 3-D+t volumes as produced by medical devices like Computed Tomography, various coding schemes can be applied. This paper shows that 3-D subband coding outperforms lossless HEVC coding and additionally provides a scalable representation, which is often required in telemedicine applications. However, the resulting lowpass subband, which shall be used as a downscaled representative of the whole original sequence, contains a lot of ghosting artifacts. This can be alleviated by incorporating motion compensation methods into the subband coder. This results in a high quality lowpass subband but also leads to a lower compression ratio. In order to cope with this, we introduce a new approach for improving the compression efficiency of compensated 3-D wavelet lifting by performing denoising in the update step. We are able to reduce the file size of the lowpass subband by up to 1.64\\%, while the lowpass subband is still applicable for being used as a downscaled representative of the whole original sequence.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01014v1","created":"2023-02-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Compression of Dynamic Medical CT Data Using Motion Compensated Wavelet Lifting with Denoised Update For the lossless compression of dynamic 3-D+t volumes as produced by medical devices like Computed Tomography, various coding schemes can be applied.

To address these issues, we propose a pseudo-siamese Graph Neural Network method, namely MTINet+, which learns both biomedical network topological and molecule structural/chemical information as representations to predict potential interaction of given molecule and target pair. In MTINet+, 1-hop subgraphs of given molecule and target pair are extracted from known interaction of biomedical network as topological information, meanwhile the molecule structural and chemical attributes are processed as molecule information. MTINet+ learns these two types of information as embedding features for predicting the pair link.

{"title":"3D Coverage Path Planning for Efficient Construction Progress Monitoring","description":"On construction sites, progress must be monitored continuously to ensure that the current state corresponds to the planned state in order to increase efficiency, safety and detect construction defects at an early stage. Autonomous mobile robots can document the state of construction with high data quality and consistency. However, finding a path that fully covers the construction site is a challenging task as it can be large, slowly changing over time, and contain dynamic objects. Existing approaches are either exploration approaches that require a long time to explore the entire building, object scanning approaches that are not suitable for large and complex buildings, or planning approaches that only consider 2D coverage. In this paper, we present a novel approach for planning an efficient 3D path for progress monitoring on large construction sites with multiple levels. By making use of an existing 3D model we ensure that all surfaces of the building are covered by the sensor payload such as a 360-degree camera or a lidar. This enables the consistent and reliable monitoring of construction site progress with an autonomous ground robot. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planner on an artificial and a real building model, showing that much shorter paths and better coverage are achieved than with a traditional exploration planner.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00968v1","created":"2023-02-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"3D Coverage Path Planning for Efficient Construction Progress Monitoring On construction sites, progress must be monitored continuously to ensure that the current state corresponds to the planned state in order to increase efficiency, safety and detect construction defects at an early stage.

{"title":"[R] Topologically evolving new self-modifying multi-task learning algorithms","description":"I\u2019ve been developing this idea since I first thought of it in mid December last year. Here\u2019s the elevator pitch (skip to how for technical details):\n\n# Why?\n\nExisting models and learning algorithms are extremely static and unable to generalize across tasks as well as humans or to adapt well to new / changing business requirements. This even applies to the final solutions in recent AutoML (see [An Empirical Review of Automated Machine Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/10/1/11#sec3-computers-10-00011), [AutoML: A survey of the state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00709)). Beyond being static, most suffer from a need for high-performance systems with large amounts of compute and/or memory. This static and bloated nature not only limits the reusability of code, pipelines and all the computations that went into previous versions of a model architecture upon finding a better one. It also forces our preconceptions of what type of learning is best for the task and which degrees of freedom are needed onto the solution. Instead of perpetuating all these assumptions, I want to create a sort of AutoML capable, under the right conditions, of even developing a learning algorithm / model combination that can dynamically add or remove inputs and outputs subsequently incorporating them into the network with adaptive online self-directed learning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How?\n\nBasically, the idea in a nutshell is to use some form of NEAT ([neuro evolution of augmenting topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) and have special nodes in the network that will be activated based on different criteria (depending on the node\u2019s allele for that gene). When activated, however, these special nodes would not send any input forward but instead apply some property change(s) to their connected nodes and/or edges (yes they can connect to an edge and they could choose a subset of their connections or just apply the change(s) to all or use a maximum number of connection hops, etc). It could also create and destroy nodes depending on the effects defined by the allele. There would also be different firing policies (like the normal always fire or thresholding with or without decay, etc.) for all nodes to allow for better leveraging of temporal dynamics. Basically every property of all these policies, including the policy template itself is a potential target for modification by the special neuromodulatory nodes along with the normal properties of a \u201cneuron\u201d like bias, input weights, activation function, aggregation function, etc. The fitness function would either be abstracted away by using rtNEAT in a simulated environment or just be a combined score over a set of simulated tasks. This should add a regularizing force if the tasks are similar enough to help enforce generalization of the evolved algorithms. There should be no limitation placed on cycles in the graph, in fact I would expect cycles to be part of the evolved solutions, which would make them dynamical systems.

{"title":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?","description":"I've worked for some years developing scientific applications for GPUs. Recently we've been trying to integrate FPGAs into our technologies; and consequently I've been trying to understand what they are useful for.\n\nI've found many posts here and there that claim that FPGAs are better suited than GPUs to accelerate Deep Learning/AI workloads (for example, [this one by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/programmable/fpga-gpu.html)). However, I don't understand why that would be the case. I think the problem is that all those posts try to explain what an FPGA is and what its differences are to a GPU, so that people that work on Deep Learning understand why they are better suited. Nevertheless, my position is exactly the opposite: I know quite well how a GPU works and what it is good for, I know well enough how an FPGA works and how it differs from a GPU, **but I do not know enough about Deep Learning** to understand why Deep Learning applicatios would benefit more from the special features of FPGAs rather than from the immense parallelism GPUs offers.\n\nAs far as I know, an FPGA will never beat a traditional GPU in terms of raw parallelism (or, if it does, it would be much less cost efficient). Thus, when it comes to matrix multiplications, i.e. the main operation in Deep Learning models, or convolutions, GPUs can parallelly work with much bigger matrices. The only explanation I can think of is that traditional Deep Learning applications don't necessarily use such big matrices, but rather smaller ones that can also be fully parallelized in FPGAs and benefit highly from custom-hardware optimizations (optimized matrix multiplications/tensor operations, working with reduced-bit values such as FP16, deep-pipeline parallelism, ...). However, given the recent increase in popularity of very complex models (GPT-3, dall-e, and the like) which boast using millions or even billions of parameters, it is hard to imagine that popular deep learning models work with small matrices of which fully parallel architectures can be synthesized in FPGAs.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any insight will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10s3u1s/why_are_fpgas_better_than_gpus_for_deep_learning/","created":"2023-02-03","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":6},"text":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?

{"title":"Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Wind Power Forecasts","description":"In recent years, researchers proposed a variety of deep learning models for wind power forecasting. These models predict the wind power generation of wind farms or entire regions more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms or physical models. However, latest research has shown that deep learning models can often be manipulated by adversarial attacks. Since wind power forecasts are essential for the stability of modern power systems, it is important to protect them from this threat. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semitargeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. We consider a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting the power generation of a wind farm and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for forecasting the wind power generation throughout Germany. Moreover, we propose the Total Adversarial Robustness Score (TARS), an evaluation metric for quantifying the robustness of regression models to targeted and semi-targeted adversarial attacks. It assesses the impact of attacks on the model's performance, as well as the extent to which the attacker's goal was achieved, by assigning a score between 0 (very vulnerable) and 1 (very robust). In our experiments, the LSTM forecasting model was fairly robust and achieved a TARS value of over 0.81 for all adversarial attacks investigated.

However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks because they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need accurate executions.

To this end, we combine \\textbf{global adaptation} and \\textbf{local generalization} in \\textit{PoseDA}, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation.

{"title":"Behavior Retrieval: Few-Shot Imitation Learning by Querying Unlabeled Datasets","description":"Enabling robots to learn novel visuomotor skills in a data-efficient manner remains an unsolved problem with myriad challenges. A popular paradigm for tackling this problem is through leveraging large unlabeled datasets that have many behaviors in them and then adapting a policy to a specific task using a small amount of task-specific human supervision (i.e. interventions or demonstrations). However, how best to leverage the narrow task-specific supervision and balance it with offline data remains an open question. Our key insight in this work is that task-specific data not only provides new data for an agent to train on but can also inform the type of prior data the agent should use for learning. Concretely, we propose a simple approach that uses a small amount of downstream expert data to selectively query relevant behaviors from an offline, unlabeled dataset (including many sub-optimal behaviors). The agent is then jointly trained on the expert and queried data. We observe that our method learns to query only the relevant transitions to the task, filtering out sub-optimal or task-irrelevant data. By doing so, it is able to learn more effectively from the mix of task-specific and offline data compared to naively mixing the data or only using the task-specific data. Furthermore, we find that our simple querying approach outperforms more complex goal-conditioned methods by 20% across simulated and real robotic manipulation tasks from images.

To explore how to use the masked language model in adversarial detection, we propose a novel textual adversarial example detection method, namely Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), which can produce clearly distinguishable signals between normal examples and adversarial examples by exploring the changes in manifolds induced by the masked language model. MLMD features a plug and play usage (i.e., no need to retrain the victim model) for adversarial defense and it is agnostic to classification tasks, victim model's architectures, and to-be-defended attack methods. We evaluate MLMD on various benchmark textual datasets, widely studied machine learning models, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attacks (in total $3*4*4 = 48$ settings).

The Dice score for nnUNet was lower than for TraBS on the internal testset (0.909$\\pm$0.069 versus 0.916$\\pm$0.067, P<0.001) and on the external testset (0.824$\\pm$0.144 versus 0.864$\\pm$0.081, P=0.004). Moreover, the average symmetric surface distance was higher (=worse) for nnUNet than for TraBS on the internal (0.657$\\pm$2.856 versus 0.548$\\pm$2.195, P=0.001) and on the external testset (0.727$\\pm$0.620 versus 0.584$\\pm$0.413, P=0.03). Our study demonstrates that transformer-based networks improve the quality of fibroglandular tissue segmentation in breast MRI compared to convolutional-based models like nnUNet. These findings might help to enhance the accuracy of breast density and parenchymal enhancement quantification in breast MRI screening.","classes":{"dataset":0.1530765146,"prompteng":0.0334178209}}
{"title":"NPS: A Framework for Accurate Program Sampling Using Graph Neural Network","description":"With the end of Moore's Law, there is a growing demand for rapid architectural innovations in modern processors, such as RISC-V custom extensions, to continue performance scaling. Program sampling is a crucial step in microprocessor design, as it selects representative simulation points for workload simulation. While SimPoint has been the de-facto approach for decades, its limited expressiveness with Basic Block Vector (BBV) requires time-consuming human tuning, often taking months, which impedes fast innovation and agile hardware development. This paper introduces Neural Program Sampling (NPS), a novel framework that learns execution embeddings using dynamic snapshots of a Graph Neural Network. NPS deploys AssemblyNet for embedding generation, leveraging an application's code structures and runtime states. AssemblyNet serves as NPS's graph model and neural architecture, capturing a program's behavior in aspects such as data computation, code path, and data flow. AssemblyNet is trained with a data prefetch task that predicts consecutive memory addresses.   In the experiments, NPS outperforms SimPoint by up to 63%, reducing the average error by 38%. Additionally, NPS demonstrates strong robustness with increased accuracy, reducing the expensive accuracy tuning overhead. Furthermore, NPS shows higher accuracy and generality than the state-of-the-art GNN approach in code behavior learning, enabling the generation of high-quality execution embeddings.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08880v1","created":"2023-04-18","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"NPS: A Framework for Accurate Program Sampling Using Graph Neural Network With the end of Moore's Law, there is a growing demand for rapid architectural innovations in modern processors, such as RISC-V custom extensions, to continue performance scaling.

{"title":"Two-stage Denoising Diffusion Model for Source Localization in Graph Inverse Problems","description":"Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications.   However, the inherent intricacy and uncertainty in information dissemination pose significant challenges, and the ill-posed nature of the source localization problem further exacerbates these challenges. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion models have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing high-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization is infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the posterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising sampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the existing methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed (many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to local optima.   To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework, the source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse stage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to generate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize the next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the convergence process. Furthermore, the introduction of cascade temporal information in this training method transforms the many-to-one mapping relationship into a one-to-one relationship, perfectly addressing the ill-posed problem. In the fine stage, we design a diffusion model for the graph inverse problem that can quantify the uncertainty in the dissemination. The proposed SL-Diff yields excellent prediction results within a reasonable sampling time at extensive experiments.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08841v1","created":"2023-04-18","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Two-stage Denoising Diffusion Model for Source Localization in Graph Inverse Problems Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications.

{"title":"Deep Unrestricted Document Image Rectification","description":"In recent years, tremendous efforts have been made on document image rectification, but existing advanced algorithms are limited to processing restricted document images, i.e., the input images must incorporate a complete document. Once the captured image merely involves a local text region, its rectification quality is degraded and unsatisfactory. Our previously proposed DocTr, a transformer-assisted network for document image rectification, also suffers from this limitation. In this work, we present DocTr++, a novel unified framework for document image rectification, without any restrictions on the input distorted images. Our major technical improvements can be concluded in three aspects. Firstly, we upgrade the original architecture by adopting a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure for multi-scale representation extraction and parsing. Secondly, we reformulate the pixel-wise mapping relationship between the unrestricted distorted document images and the distortion-free counterparts. The obtained data is used to train our DocTr++ for unrestricted document image rectification. Thirdly, we contribute a real-world test set and metrics applicable for evaluating the rectification quality. To our best knowledge, this is the first learning-based method for the rectification of unrestricted document images. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We hope our DocTr++ will serve as a strong baseline for generic document image rectification, prompting the further advancement and application of learning-based algorithms.

{"title":"Why use classes?","description":"*I originally wrote this piece as an answer to a question on the* [*learnpython reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11sebbg/been_using_python_for_3_years_never_used_a_class/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*, and it was suggested that it would be a useful learning resource for many people who struggle with* ***why*** *we use classes rather than just variables and functions.  So here it is:*\n\n# Why use classes?\n\n**My \"Ah ha!\" moment for understanding classes was understanding that a** ***class*** **creates** ***objects*** **and defines the** ***type*** **of** ***object.***\n\nTime for an example:\n\nSay that we're writing a game, and we need to define certain things about the player:\n\n    player_name = \"James\"\n    player_level = \"novice\"\n\nWe also need to keep track of the player's score:\n\n    player_score = 0\n\nWe may also need to save each of the player's moves:\n\n    player_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n\nand now we need to be able to increase the player's score when they win some points, and to add their last move to their list of moves. We can do this with a function:\n\n    def win_points (points, move):\n        player_score += points\n        player_moves.append(move)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all fine so far. We have some global variables to hold the player's data, and a function to handle the results of a win, and all without writing any classes.\n\nNow say that we need to add another player. We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11ts1qq/why_use_classes/","created":"2023-03-17","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":95},"text":"Why use classes? *I originally wrote this piece as an answer to a question on the* [*learnpython reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11sebbg/been_using_python_for_3_years_never_used_a_class/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*, and it was suggested that it would be a useful learning resource for many people who struggle with* ***why*** *we use classes rather than just variables and functions.

We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.","classes":{"dataset":0.350150466,"prompteng":0.2514321804}}

The 3D semantic data are useful for core perception tasks such as obstacle detection and ego-vehicle localization. We propose a new dataset, Navya 3D Segmentation (Navya3DSeg), with a diverse label space corresponding to a large scale production grade operational domain, including rural, urban, industrial sites and universities from 13 countries. It contains 23 labeled sequences and 25 supplementary sequences without labels, designed to explore self-supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks on point clouds. We also propose a novel method for sequential dataset split generation based on iterative multi-label stratification, and demonstrated to achieve a +1.2% mIoU improvement over the original split proposed by SemanticKITTI dataset. A complete benchmark for semantic segmentation task was performed, with state of the art methods. Finally, we demonstrate an active learning (AL) based dataset distillation framework.

While prior work has shown how social networks respond to shocks, these studies usually treat all ties equally, despite differences in the support provided by different social relationships. Here, we conduct a computational analysis on Twitter that examines how responses to online shocks differ by the relationship type of a user dyad. We introduce a new dataset of over 13K instances of individuals' self-reporting shock events on Twitter and construct networks of relationship-labeled dyadic interactions around these events. By examining behaviors across 110K replies to shocked users in a pseudo-causal analysis, we demonstrate relationship-specific patterns in response levels and topic shifts. We also show that while well-established social dimensions of closeness such as tie strength and structural embeddedness contribute to shock responsiveness, the degree of impact is highly dependent on relationship and shock types.

Up to date, the AC prediction problem, i.e., to predict whether a pair of molecules exhibit the AC relationship, has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we first introduce ACNet, a large-scale dataset for AC prediction. ACNet curates over 400K Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) against 190 targets, including over 20K MMP-cliffs and 380K non-AC MMPs, and provides five subsets for model development and evaluation.

Our experimental results show that deep learning models can achieve good performance when the models are trained on tasks with adequate amount of data, while the imbalanced, low-data and out-of-distribution features of the ACNet dataset still make it challenging for deep neural networks to cope with.

We first propose edge-level immunization to vaccinate node pairs. Despite the primary success, such edge-level immunization cannot defend against emerging node injection attacks, since it only immunizes existing node pairs. To this end, we further propose node-level immunization. To circumvent computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving adversarial immunization, we design AdvImmune-Edge and AdvImmune-Node algorithms to effectively obtain the immune node pairs or nodes. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdvImmune methods. In particular, AdvImmune-Node remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 79%, 294%, and 100%, after immunizing only 5% nodes.

{"title":"Balancing Privacy Protection and Interpretability in Federated Learning","description":"Federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train the global model in a distributed manner by sharing the model parameters from local clients to a central server, thereby potentially protecting users' private information.

To deal with this issue, differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local models before aggregation.

{"title":"Log Parsing with Prompt-based Few-shot Learning","description":"Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07435v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Log Parsing with Prompt-based Few-shot Learning Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems.

{"title":"URCDC-Depth: Uncertainty Rectified Cross-Distillation with CutFlip for Monocular Depth Estimation","description":"This work aims to estimate a high-quality depth map from a single RGB image. Due to the lack of depth clues, making full use of the long-range correlation and the local information is critical for accurate depth estimation. Towards this end, we introduce an uncertainty rectified cross-distillation between Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a unified depth estimator. Specifically, we use the depth estimates derived from the Transformer branch and the CNN branch as pseudo labels to teach each other. Meanwhile, we model the pixel-wise depth uncertainty to rectify the loss weights of noisy depth labels. To avoid the large performance gap induced by the strong Transformer branch deteriorating the cross-distillation, we transfer the feature maps from Transformer to CNN and design coupling units to assist the weak CNN branch to utilize the transferred features. Furthermore, we propose a surprisingly simple yet highly effective data augmentation technique CutFlip, which enforces the model to exploit more valuable clues apart from the clue of vertical image position for depth estimation.

{"title":"Fossil Image Identification using Deep Learning Ensembles of Data Augmented Multiviews","description":"Identification of fossil species is crucial to evolutionary studies. Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to the training of deep learning based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a novel multiview ensemble framework, which collects multiple views of each fossil specimen image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base deep learning models and then makes final decisions via soft voting. We further develop OGS method that integrates original, gray, and skeleton views under this framework to demonstrate the effectiveness. Experimental results on the fusulinid fossil dataset over five deep learning based milestone models show that OGS using three base models consistently outperforms the baseline using a single base model, and the ablation study verifies the usefulness of each selected view. Besides, OGS obtains the superior or comparable performance compared to the method under well-known bagging framework. Moreover, as the available training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more performance gains compared to the baseline. Furthermore, a consistency test with two human experts shows that OGS obtains the highest agreement with both the labels of dataset and the two experts. Notably, this methodology is designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to see applications on other fossil datasets.

{"title":"Vector-based Efficient Data Hiding in Encrypted Images via Multi-MSB Replacement","description":"As an essential technique for data privacy protection, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) methods have drawn intensive research interest in recent years. In response to the increasing demand for protecting data privacy, novel methods that perform RDHEI are continually being developed. We propose two effective multi-MSB (most significant bit) replacement-based approaches that yield comparably high data embedding capacity, improve overall processing speed, and enhance reconstructed images' quality. Our first method, Efficient Multi-MSB Replacement-RDHEI (EMR-RDHEI), obtains higher data embedding rates (DERs, also known as payloads) and better visual quality in reconstructed images when compared with many other state-of-the-art methods. Our second method, Lossless Multi-MSB Replacement-RDHEI (LMR-RDHEI), can losslessly recover original images after an information embedding process is performed. To verify the accuracy of our methods, we compared them with other recent RDHEI techniques and performed extensive experiments using the widely accepted BOWS-2 dataset. Our experimental results showed that the DER of our EMR-RDHEI method ranged from 1.2087 bit per pixel (bpp) to 6.2682 bpp with an average of 3.2457 bpp. For the LMR-RDHEI method, the average DER was 2.5325 bpp, with a range between 0.2129 bpp and 6.0168 bpp. Our results demonstrate that these methods outperform many other state-of-the-art RDHEI algorithms.

{"title":"Clustering-Based Inter-Regional Correlation Estimation","description":"A novel non-parametric estimator of the correlation between grouped measurements of a quantity is proposed in the presence of noise. This work is primarily motivated by functional brain network construction from fMRI data, where brain regions correspond to groups of spatial units, and correlation between region pairs defines the network. The challenge resides in the fact that both noise and intra-regional correlation lead to inconsistent inter-regional correlation estimation using classical approaches. While some existing methods handle either one of these issues, no non-parametric approaches tackle both simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a trade-off between two procedures: correlating regional averages, which is not robust to intra-regional correlation; and averaging pairwise inter-regional correlations, which is not robust to noise. To that end, we project the data onto a space where Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for sample correlation. We then propose to leverage hierarchical clustering to gather together highly correlated variables within each region prior to inter-regional correlation estimation.

{"title":"[R] Does a new published ML dataset always need to have an official train-dev-test split? Should the test set be made balanced?","description":"I have constructed a novel ML (NLP) dataset for classification and labeled it with three classes. The dataset is rather small with about 700 examples, out of which the classes have about 400, 200, and 100 examples respectively. I would like to publish it and describe it in an official publication for a workshop or a conference.\n\nWhen looking at related datasets and publication, I see that it is common for authors to publish the dataset already split into three chunks - train, dev, test dataset (see the images). It is also common in these papers to provide the performance of baseline models on the dataset. Considering the dataset's small size, I feel like doing a 5-fold cross-validation would be a good alternative for such a small dataset, rather than doing something like a split into 450-100-150 train-dev-test datasets and then evaluating only on the very small dataset with 150 examples. Still, I believe that for better replicability, doing an \"official\" split is preferred and then everyone in the future testing on the same test set with 150 examples? Why do the authors usually already provide the three splits?\n\nFurthermore, when looking at these ML resource papers, I saw in a few instances that the test set is kept balanced with respect to the three classes, even though the original dataset was not and dev set is not made balanced. This is problematic in my case for my third class where there are only about 100 examples. If I make my test set to be 50-50-50 for class1-class2-class3, then there is only 50 examples of class3 left for train+dev! That is simply infeasible for the training set. None of the authors provide any sort of explanation why they split it like this, they just seem to say \"here is our split\". Is this done to discourage the model from just doing a majority-class prediction and thus make it challenging? Or because a dummy classifier would have a 60% accuracy?

{"title":"How to debug Python applications","description":"# \n\n[How to debug Python applications](https://preview.redd.it/s5qps8ns2jia1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c8bfff4fbe2c52e9611f2169fa4cb9de91829322)\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn software development, testing is an essential part of ensuring that code works as intended. One critical aspect of testing is debugging, which involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In this article, we'll explore how to debug Python applications and highlight some of the most commonly used methods for debugging Python code.\n\n## Debugging options\n\nWhen it comes to debugging Python, there are multiple options available, and you should consider which one suits your needs best. Two popular options are IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools.\n\n## IDE Debugging Tools\n\nIDEs like PyCharm and VSCode offer debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints in your code and run it in debug mode. This allows you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. Here are some resources for learning how to use the debugging tools in PyCharm and VSCode:\n\n* [Debugging Python in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html)\n* [Debugging Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)\n\n## Package Debugging Tools\n\nLinks:\n\n* [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n* [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)\n* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)\n\nPython also offers built-in debugging tools, such as the `pdb` module, which allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code in a console-based debugger. Additionally, there are alternative packages like `ipdb`, which is based on the `IPython` tool and provides a more powerful debugger. Here is an example of how to use the `pdb` module in your code:\n\n**my\\_module.py**\n\n    def something(val: str) -&gt; int:\n        val += \" world\"\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n        # If you want a more powerful debugger, use `ipdb`.\n        # Note, that this requires installation of `ipdb`\n        #     $ pip install ipdb\n        # Then, comment out the `mport pdb; ...` and \n        # uncomment the following line:\n        # import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n    \n    my_str = \"Hello\"\n    \n    print(something(my_str))\n\nIn the example code above, we set a breakpoint in the `something()` function using the `pdb.set_trace()` function. When the code reaches this point, it will pause execution and drop into the debugger, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n\n**Run it**\n\n    python my_module.py\n\n**What would you see**\n\n    $ python my_module.py \n    --Return--\n    &gt; /home/artur.local/repos/tryouts/debug/my_module.py(3)something()-&gt;None\n    -&gt; import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n    (Pdb) locals()\n    {'val': 'Hello world', 'pdb': &lt;module 'pdb' from '/usr/lib64/python3.11/pdb.py'&gt;, '__return__': None}\n    (Pdb) val\n    'Hello world'\n    (Pdb)\n\nStudy `pdb` documentation for more.\n\n**Good to know**\n\nIt works similarly with your web views (like, FastAPI/Flask/Django).\n\n    def your_view(request):\n       # ...\n       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\n## Best Practices for Debugging Python\n\nWhile debugging is an essential part of the development process, there are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable.\n\n## Don't commit your debug code!\n\nLinks:\n\n* [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)\n\nOne critical practice is to avoid committing your debug code to your code repository. Debug code can clutter your codebase and make it more challenging to maintain. To avoid committing debug code, use a tool like `pre-commit` and linters like `ruff` to catch and prevent it from being committed.\n\n## Debugging in Docker\n\nIf you use Docker for development, you need to configure your `docker-compose.yml` to allow debugging. You can do this by setting the `stdin_open` and `tty` options for your service:\n\n    version: '3'\n    \n    services:\n      api:\n        # Other configuration\n        stdin_open: true\n        tty: true\n\nAfter configuring your Docker environment, assuming that you have it running already, you can find the container ID (`CONTAINER ID`) for your service (in the example above - `api` service) using `docker ps` and attach to it with the `docker attach` (`docker attach {CONTAINER ID}`) command to start debugging. Note, that you will need to run the `docker attach` command in a separate shell/terminal tab and that's where the debug prompt will appear.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDebugging Python is an essential skill for any developer, and it's crucial to understand the available options and best practices. In this article, we explored two popular options for debugging Python: IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools. We also highlighted some best practices for debugging in Python, including avoiding committing debug code and configuring Docker for debugging. With this knowledge, you'll be better equipped to debug Python applications and write clean, maintainable code.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/113n1dd/how_to_debug_python_applications/","created":"2023-02-16","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":1},"text":"How to debug Python applications # \n\n[How to debug Python applications](https://preview.redd.it/s5qps8ns2jia1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c8bfff4fbe2c52e9611f2169fa4cb9de91829322)\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn software development, testing is an essential part of ensuring that code works as intended. One critical aspect of testing is debugging, which involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In this article, we'll explore how to debug Python applications and highlight some of the most commonly used methods for debugging Python code.\n\n## Debugging options\n\nWhen it comes to debugging Python, there are multiple options available, and you should consider which one suits your needs best. Two popular options are IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools.\n\n## IDE Debugging Tools\n\nIDEs like PyCharm and VSCode offer debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints in your code and run it in debug mode. This allows you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. Here are some resources for learning how to use the debugging tools in PyCharm and VSCode:\n\n* [Debugging Python in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html)\n* [Debugging Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)\n\n## Package Debugging Tools\n\nLinks:\n\n* [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n* [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)\n* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)\n\nPython also offers built-in debugging tools, such as the `pdb` module, which allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code in a console-based debugger. Additionally, there are alternative packages like `ipdb`, which is based on the `IPython` tool and provides a more powerful debugger. Here is an example of how to use the `pdb` module in your code:\n\n**my\\_module.py**\n\n    def something(val: str) -&gt; int:\n        val += \" world\"\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n        # If you want a more powerful debugger, use `ipdb`.\n        # Note, that this requires installation of `ipdb`\n        #     $ pip install ipdb\n        # Then, comment out the `mport pdb; ...` and \n        # uncomment the following line:\n        # import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n    \n    my_str = \"Hello\"\n    \n    print(something(my_str))\n\nIn the example code above, we set a breakpoint in the `something()` function using the `pdb.set_trace()` function. When the code reaches this point, it will pause execution and drop into the debugger, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n\n**Run it**\n\n    python my_module.py\n\n**What would you see**\n\n    $ python my_module.py \n    --Return--\n    &gt; /home/artur.local/repos/tryouts/debug/my_module.py(3)something()-&gt;None\n    -&gt; import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n    (Pdb) locals()\n    {'val': 'Hello world', 'pdb': &lt;module 'pdb' from '/usr/lib64/python3.11/pdb.py'&gt;, '__return__': None}\n    (Pdb) val\n    'Hello world'\n    (Pdb)\n\nStudy `pdb` documentation for more.\n\n**Good to know**\n\nIt works similarly with your web views (like, FastAPI/Flask/Django).\n\n    def your_view(request):\n       # ...\n       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\n## Best Practices for Debugging Python\n\nWhile debugging is an essential part of the development process, there are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable.\n\n## Don't commit your debug code!\n\nLinks:\n\n* [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)\n\nOne critical practice is to avoid committing your debug code to your code repository.

The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy. The paper also presents a fully automated pipeline for VPR database creation from RGBD scanning sequences, as well as a set of metrics for VPR database evaluation.

These mismatches may lead to inaccurate predictions and errors, resulting in poor product quality and unreliable systems. In this study, we propose StyleDiff to inform developers of the differences between the two datasets for the steady development of machine learning systems. Using disentangled image spaces obtained from recently proposed generative models, StyleDiff compares the two datasets by focusing on attributes in the images and provides an easy-to-understand analysis of the differences between the datasets. The proposed StyleDiff performs in $O (d N\\log N)$, where $N$ is the size of the datasets and $d$ is the number of attributes, enabling the application to large datasets.

{"title":"Contributing to Accessibility Datasets: Reflections on Sharing Study Data by Blind People","description":"To ensure that AI-infused systems work for disabled people, we need to bring accessibility datasets sourced from this community in the development lifecycle. However, there are many ethical and privacy concerns limiting greater data inclusion, making such datasets not readily available. We present a pair of studies where 13 blind participants engage in data capturing activities and reflect with and without probing on various factors that influence their decision to share their data via an AI dataset. We see how different factors influence blind participants' willingness to share study data as they assess risk-benefit tradeoffs. The majority support sharing of their data to improve technology but also express concerns over commercial use, associated metadata, and the lack of transparency about the impact of their data. These insights have implications for the development of responsible practices for stewarding accessibility datasets, and can contribute to broader discussions in this area.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04962v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Contributing to Accessibility Datasets: Reflections on Sharing Study Data by Blind People To ensure that AI-infused systems work for disabled people, we need to bring accessibility datasets sourced from this community in the development lifecycle.

We see how different factors influence blind participants' willingness to share study data as they assess risk-benefit tradeoffs. The majority support sharing of their data to improve technology but also express concerns over commercial use, associated metadata, and the lack of transparency about the impact of their data. These insights have implications for the development of responsible practices for stewarding accessibility datasets, and can contribute to broader discussions in this area.","classes":{"dataset":0.9674330354,"prompteng":0.0006481268}}
{"title":"FedREP: A Byzantine-Robust, Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Federated Learning","description":"Federated learning (FL) has recently become a hot research topic, in which Byzantine robustness, communication efficiency and privacy preservation are three important aspects. However, the tension among these three aspects makes it hard to simultaneously take all of them into account. In view of this challenge, we theoretically analyze the conditions that a communication compression method should satisfy to be compatible with existing Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Motivated by the analysis results, we propose a novel communication compression method called consensus sparsification (ConSpar). To the best of our knowledge, ConSpar is the first communication compression method that is designed to be compatible with both Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Based on ConSpar, we further propose a novel FL framework called FedREP, which is Byzantine-robust, communication-efficient and privacy-preserving. We theoretically prove the Byzantine robustness and the convergence of FedREP. Empirical results show that FedREP can significantly outperform communication-efficient privacy-preserving baselines. Furthermore, compared with Byzantine-robust communication-efficient baselines, FedREP can achieve comparable accuracy with the extra advantage of privacy preservation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05206v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"FedREP: A Byzantine-Robust, Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Federated Learning Federated learning (FL) has recently become a hot research topic, in which Byzantine robustness, communication efficiency and privacy preservation are three important aspects.

{"title":"Greener yet Powerful: Taming Large Code Generation Models with Quantization","description":"ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner, by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have substantially pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. Despite their great power, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant threat to adapting them in a regular software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server to develop her code. Such large models incur significant resource usage (in terms of memory, latency, and dollars) as well as carbon footprint.   Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges. Several techniques are proposed to compress large pretrained models typically used for vision or textual data. Out of many available compression techniques, we identified that quantization is mostly applicable for code generation task as it does not require significant retraining cost. As quantization represents model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and runtime latency would both benefit from such int representation. We extensively study the impact of quantized model on code generation tasks across different dimension: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. To this end, through systematic experiments we find a recipe of quantization technique that could run even a $6$B model in a regular laptop without significant accuracy or robustness degradation.

{"title":"Intriguing Property of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation","description":"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, we discover an extraordinary phenomenon: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Based on this discovery, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively.

{"title":"Parallel Filtered Graphs for Hierarchical Clustering","description":"Given all pairwise weights (distances) among a set of objects, filtered graphs provide a sparse representation by only keeping an important subset of weights. Such graphs can be passed to graph clustering algorithms to generate hierarchical clusters.

We propose a new parallel algorithm for constructing triangulated maximally filtered graphs (TMFG), which produces valid inputs for DBHT, and a scalable parallel algorithm for generating DBHTs that is optimized for TMFG inputs. In addition to parallelizing the original TMFG construction, which has limited parallelism, we also design a new algorithm that inserts multiple vertices on each round to enable more parallelism. We show that the graphs generated by our new algorithm have similar quality compared to the original TMFGs, while being much faster to generate.

I know for a fact that I will only use my model on this one camera and that the position and rotation of my camera will never change. Normally when building a dataset, especially for computer vision models, you want to include diverse data to ensure that objects can be detected regardless of their surroundings. However in this case one can make the assumption that the surroundings will largely be static other than some minor variations. For this example does it make more sense to train a model on images collected from the perspective of the camera itself, or should a variety of dog pictures in various environments still be used? My thought process is that if we know enough about the conditions the model will be deployed in it would make more sense to provide training data that reflects this real world usage, but pretty much all the sources I've found online always say your dataset should be diverse. I'm curious to hear what reddit's thoughts on this approach are, or if there's any research that's been done into this topic that I've missed.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11mvjtu/d_is_a_diverse_dataset_necessary_for_accuracy_if/","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["machinelearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":3},"text":"[D] Is a diverse dataset necessary for accuracy if the conditions in which inference will be used are narrow?

It's worth noting that my main interest in NLP is prompt-based applications, rather than text completion.","classes":{"dataset":0.5109590292,"prompteng":0.0238072742}}

I've created a Google sheets file that's set up with formulas to crunch all the numbers for me. All I have to do is copy that delivery data from the website to the sheet and it automaticly calculates the rest. The website takes 60 seconds at least to collect the delivery data on one delivery. I compare it to what I have in the sheet and add in the new information. In order to keep up with the deliveries, I usually try to do data entry on about 100 entries each day.

{"title":"Knowledge Accumulation in Continually Learned Representations and the Issue of Feature Forgetting","description":"By default, neural networks learn on all training data at once. When such a model is trained on sequential chunks of new data, it tends to catastrophically forget how to handle old data. In this work we investigate how continual learners learn and forget representations. We observe two phenomena: knowledge accumulation, i.e. the improvement of a representation over time, and feature forgetting, i.e. the loss of task-specific representations. To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one.

When such a model is trained on sequential chunks of new data, it tends to catastrophically forget how to handle old data. In this work we investigate how continual learners learn and forget representations. We observe two phenomena: knowledge accumulation, i.e. the improvement of a representation over time, and feature forgetting, i.e. the loss of task-specific representations. To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one. Our image classification experiments show that most task-specific features are quickly forgotten, in contrast to what has been suggested in the past. Further, we demonstrate how some continual learning methods, like replay, and ideas from representation learning affect a continually learned representation.

{"title":"Adoption of Adaptive Learning Platforms in Schools: Unveiling Factors Influencing Teachers Engagement","description":"Albeit existing evidence about the impact of AI-based adaptive learning platforms, their scaled adoption in schools is slow at best. In addition, AI tools adopted in schools may not always be the considered and studied re-search products of the research community. Therefore, there have been in-creasing concerns about identifying factors influencing adoption, and studying the extent to which these factors can be used to predict teachers engagement with adaptive learning platforms. To address this, we developed a reliable instrument to measure more holistic factors influencing teachers adoption of adaptive learning platforms in schools. In addition, we present the results of its implementation with school teachers (n=792) sampled from a large country-level population and use this data to predict teachers real-world engagement with the adaptive learning platform in schools. Our results show that although teachers knowledge, confidence and product quality are all important factors, they are not necessarily the only, may not even be the most important factors influencing the teachers engagement with AI platforms in schools. Not generating any additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating support mechanisms for help, and assuring that ethical issues are minimised, are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers engagement with the platform better. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the value of factors identified to increase the real-world adoption and effectiveness of adaptive learning platforms by increasing the dimensions of variability in prediction models and decreasing the implementation variability in practice.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00903v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Adoption of Adaptive Learning Platforms in Schools: Unveiling Factors Influencing Teachers Engagement Albeit existing evidence about the impact of AI-based adaptive learning platforms, their scaled adoption in schools is slow at best.

{"title":"MetaHead: An Engine to Create Realistic Digital Head","description":"Collecting and labeling training data is one important step for learning-based methods because the process is time-consuming and biased. For face analysis tasks, although some generative models can be used to generate face data, they can only achieve a subset of generation diversity, reconstruction accuracy, 3D consistency, high-fidelity visual quality, and easy editability. One recent related work is the graphics-based generative method, but it can only render low realism head with high computation cost. In this paper, we propose MetaHead, a unified and full-featured controllable digital head engine, which consists of a controllable head radiance field(MetaHead-F) to super-realistically generate or reconstruct view-consistent 3D controllable digital heads and a generic top-down image generation framework LabelHead to generate digital heads consistent with the given customizable feature labels. Experiments validate that our controllable digital head engine achieves the state-of-the-art generation visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the generated labeled data can assist real training data and significantly surpass the labeled data generated by graphics-based methods in terms of training effect.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00838v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"MetaHead: An Engine to Create Realistic Digital Head Collecting and labeling training data is one important step for learning-based methods because the process is time-consuming and biased.

{"title":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images","description":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRFs). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all DRF.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00725v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare.

{"title":"Accuracy Improvement of Object Detection in VVC Coded Video Using YOLO-v7 Features","description":"With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread. As the amount of video used for image recognition increases, efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general, when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video. Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method, since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance. The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection accuracy.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00689v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Accuracy Improvement of Object Detection in VVC Coded Video Using YOLO-v7 Features With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread.

In the last couple of weeks I created a small Python based project series on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

{"title":"Unleashing Infinite-Length Input Capacity for Large-scale Language Models with Self-Controlled Memory System","description":"Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by their inability to process lengthy inputs. To address this limitation, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory (SCM) system to unleash infinite-length input capacity for large-scale language models. Our SCM system is composed of three key modules: the language model agent, the memory stream, and the memory controller. The language model agent iteratively processes ultra-long inputs and stores all historical information in the memory stream. The memory controller provides the agent with both long-term memory (archived memory) and short-term memory (flash memory) to generate precise and coherent responses. The controller determines which memories from archived memory should be activated and how to incorporate them into the model input. Our SCM system can be integrated with any LLMs to enable them to process ultra-long texts without any modification or fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our SCM system enables LLMs, which are not optimized for multi-turn dialogue, to achieve multi-turn dialogue capabilities that are comparable to ChatGPT, and to outperform ChatGPT in scenarios involving ultra-long document summarization or long-term conversations.

{"title":"Explainable Automated Debugging via Large Language Model-driven Scientific Debugging","description":"Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02195v1","created":"2023-04-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Explainable Automated Debugging via Large Language Model-driven Scientific Debugging Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry.

Yet most previous methods simply apply fixed composition of data augmentations to improve data efficiency, which ignores the changes in their optimal settings over training.

In this work, we propose AdDA, which implements a closed-loop feedback structure to a generic contrastive learning network. AdDA works by allowing the network to adaptively adjust the augmentation compositions according to the real-time feedback.

To address this shortcoming in the machine learning ecosystem, we introduce DataComp, a benchmark where the training code is fixed and researchers innovate by proposing new training sets. We provide a testbed for dataset experiments centered around a new candidate pool of 12.8B image-text pairs from Common Crawl. Participants in our benchmark design new filtering techniques or curate new data sources and then evaluate their new dataset by running our standardized CLIP training code and testing on 38 downstream test sets. Our benchmark consists of multiple scales, with four candidate pool sizes and associated compute budgets ranging from 12.8M to 12.8B samples seen during training. This multi-scale design facilitates the study of scaling trends and makes the benchmark accessible to researchers with varying resources.   Our baseline experiments show that the DataComp workflow is a promising way of improving multimodal datasets.

To this end, we retrained the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) 2 method, which was originally designed for contact-based fingerprints, with a synthetic contactless fingerprint database. We evaluate the predictive performance of the resulting MCLFIQ model in terms of Error-vs.-Discard Characteristic (EDC) curves on three real-world contactless fingerprint databases using two recognition algorithms. In experiments, the MCLFIQ method is compared against the original NFIQ 2 method and a sharpness-based quality assessment algorithm developed for contactless fingerprint images.

To this end, we retrained the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) 2 method, which was originally designed for contact-based fingerprints, with a synthetic contactless fingerprint database. We evaluate the predictive performance of the resulting MCLFIQ model in terms of Error-vs.-Discard Characteristic (EDC) curves on three real-world contactless fingerprint databases using two recognition algorithms. In experiments, the MCLFIQ method is compared against the original NFIQ 2 method and a sharpness-based quality assessment algorithm developed for contactless fingerprint images.

{"title":"Learning and Reasoning Multifaceted and Longitudinal Data for Poverty Estimates and Livelihood Capabilities of Lagged Regions in Rural India","description":"Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon linked to the lack of capabilities of households to earn a sustainable livelihood, increasingly being assessed using multidimensional indicators. Its spatial pattern depends on social, economic, political, and regional variables. Artificial intelligence has shown immense scope in analyzing the complexities and nuances of poverty. The proposed project aims to examine the poverty situation of rural India for the period of 1990-2022 based on the quality of life and livelihood indicators. The districts will be classified into `advanced', `catching up', `falling behind', and `lagged' regions. The project proposes to integrate multiple data sources, including conventional national-level large sample household surveys, census surveys, and proxy variables like daytime, and nighttime data from satellite images, and communication networks, to name a few, to provide a comprehensive view of poverty at the district level. The project also intends to examine causation and longitudinal analysis to examine the reasons for poverty. Poverty and inequality could be widening in developing countries due to demographic and growth-agglomerating policies. Therefore, targeting the lagging regions and the vulnerable population is essential to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life to achieve the goal of `zero poverty'. Thus, the study also focuses on the districts with a higher share of the marginal section of the population compared to the national average to trace the performance of development indicators and their association with poverty in these regions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13958v1","created":"2023-04-27","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Learning and Reasoning Multifaceted and Longitudinal Data for Poverty Estimates and Livelihood Capabilities of Lagged Regions in Rural India Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon linked to the lack of capabilities of households to earn a sustainable livelihood, increasingly being assessed using multidimensional indicators.

{"title":"Why Existing Multimodal Crowd Counting Datasets Can Lead to Unfulfilled Expectations in Real-World Applications","description":"More information leads to better decisions and predictions, right? Confirming this hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical and thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting. However, the way multimodal models extract enriched features from both modalities is not yet fully understood. Since the use of multimodal data usually increases the complexity, inference time, and memory requirements of the models, it is relevant to examine the differences and advantages of multimodal compared to monomodal models. In this work, all available multimodal datasets for crowd counting are used to investigate the differences between monomodal and multimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that considers the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In addition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different multimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal architecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general. Surprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the existing datasets. We found that the existing datasets hold a bias toward thermal images. This was determined by analyzing the relationship between the brightness of optical images and crowd count as well as examining the annotations made for each dataset.

{"title":"AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation Models","description":"Evaluating the general abilities of foundation models to tackle human-level tasks is a vital aspect of their development and application in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Traditional benchmarks, which rely on artificial datasets, may not accurately represent human-level capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess foundation model in the context of human-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark. Impressively, GPT-4 surpasses average human performance on SAT, LSAT, and math competitions, attaining a 95% accuracy rate on the SAT Math test and a 92.5% accuracy on the English test of the Chinese national college entrance exam. This demonstrates the extraordinary performance of contemporary foundation models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks that require complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive analyses of model capabilities (understanding, knowledge, reasoning, and calculation) reveal these models' strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into future directions for enhancing their general capabilities. By concentrating on tasks pertinent to human cognition and decision-making, our benchmark delivers a more meaningful and robust evaluation of foundation models' performance in real-world scenarios.

{"title":"Improving novelty detection with generative adversarial networks on hand gesture data","description":"We propose a novel way of solving the issue of classification of out-of-vocabulary gestures using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. A generative model augments the data set in an online fashion with new samples and stochastic target vectors, while a discriminative model determines the class of the samples. The approach was evaluated on the UC2017 SG and UC2018 DualMyo data sets. The generative models performance was measured with a distance metric between generated and real samples. The discriminative models were evaluated by their accuracy on trained and novel classes. In terms of sample generation quality, the GAN is significantly better than a random distribution (noise) in mean distance, for all classes. In the classification tests, the baseline neural network was not capable of identifying untrained gestures. When the proposed methodology was implemented, we found that there is a trade-off between the detection of trained and untrained gestures, with some trained samples being mistaken as novelty. Nevertheless, a novelty detection accuracy of 95.4% or 90.2% (depending on the data set) was achieved with just 5% loss of accuracy on trained classes.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06696v1","created":"2023-04-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Improving novelty detection with generative adversarial networks on hand gesture data We propose a novel way of solving the issue of classification of out-of-vocabulary gestures using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework.

{"title":"Load Balanced Demand Distribution under Overload Penalties","description":"Input to the Load Balanced Demand Distribution (LBDD) consists of the following: (a) a set of public service centers (e.g., schools); (b) a set of demand (people) units and; (c) a cost matrix containing the cost of assignment for all demand unit-service center pairs. In addition, each service center is also associated with a notion of capacity and a penalty which is incurred if it gets overloaded. Given the input, the LBDD problem determines a mapping from the set of demand units to the set of service centers. The objective is to determine a mapping that minimizes the sum of the following two terms: (i) the total assignment cost between demand units and their allotted service centers and, (ii) total of penalties incurred. The problem of LBDD finds its application in the domain of urban planning. An instance of the LBDD problem can be reduced to an instance of the min-cost bi-partite matching problem. However, this approach cannot scale up to the real world large problem instances. The current state of the art related to LBDD makes simplifying assumptions such as infinite capacity or total capacity being equal to the total demand. This paper proposes a novel allotment subspace re-adjustment based approach (ASRAL) for the LBDD problem. We analyze ASRAL theoretically and present its asymptotic time complexity. We also evaluate ASRAL experimentally on large problem instances and compare with alternative approaches. Our results indicate that ASRAL is able to scale-up while maintaining significantly better solution quality over the alternative approaches. In addition, we also extend ASRAL to para-ASRAL which uses the GPU and CPU cores to speed-up the execution while maintaining the same solution quality as ASRAL.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06543v1","created":"2023-04-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Load Balanced Demand Distribution under Overload Penalties Input to the Load Balanced Demand Distribution (LBDD) consists of the following: (a) a set of public service centers (e.g., schools); (b) a set of demand (people) units and; (c) a cost matrix containing the cost of assignment for all demand unit-service center pairs.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly address this issue and deal with two major drawbacks of the existing state-of-the-art approaches, namely that they (i) require the costly training of additional, purpose-trained neural networks, and/or (ii) fail to retain the facial attributes of the original images in the anonymized counterparts, the preservation of which is of paramount importance for their use in downstream tasks. We accordingly present a task-agnostic anonymization procedure that directly optimizes the images' latent representation in the latent space of a pre-trained GAN. By optimizing the latent codes directly, we ensure both that the identity is of a desired distance away from the original (with an identity obfuscation loss), whilst preserving the facial attributes (using a novel feature-matching loss in FaRL's deep feature space).

{"title":"Learning Optical Flow from Event Camera with Rendered Dataset","description":"We study the problem of estimating optical flow from event cameras. One important issue is how to build a high-quality event-flow dataset with accurate event values and flow labels. Previous datasets are created by either capturing real scenes by event cameras or synthesizing from images with pasted foreground objects. The former case can produce real event values but with calculated flow labels, which are sparse and inaccurate. The later case can generate dense flow labels but the interpolated events are prone to errors. In this work, we propose to render a physically correct event-flow dataset using computer graphics models. In particular, we first create indoor and outdoor 3D scenes by Blender with rich scene content variations. Second, diverse camera motions are included for the virtual capturing, producing images and accurate flow labels. Third, we render high-framerate videos between images for accurate events. The rendered dataset can adjust the density of events, based on which we further introduce an adaptive density module (ADM). Experiments show that our proposed dataset can facilitate event-flow learning, whereas previous approaches when trained on our dataset can improve their performances constantly by a relatively large margin.

{"title":"Make Landscape Flatter in Differentially Private Federated Learning","description":"To defend the inference attacks and mitigate the sensitive information leakages in Federated Learning (FL), client-level Differentially Private FL (DPFL) is the de-facto standard for privacy protection by clipping local updates and adding random noise. However, existing DPFL methods tend to make a sharper loss landscape and have poorer weight perturbation robustness, resulting in severe performance degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel DPFL algorithm named DP-FedSAM, which leverages gradient perturbation to mitigate the negative impact of DP. Specifically, DP-FedSAM integrates Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to generate local flatness models with better stability and weight perturbation robustness, which results in the small norm of local updates and robustness to DP noise, thereby improving the performance. From the theoretical perspective, we analyze in detail how DP-FedSAM mitigates the performance degradation induced by DP.

{"title":"Zero-Shot Noise2Noise: Efficient Image Denoising without any Data","description":"Recently, self-supervised neural networks have shown excellent image denoising performance. However, current dataset free methods are either computationally expensive, require a noise model, or have inadequate image quality. In this work we show that a simple 2-layer network, without any training data or knowledge of the noise distribution, can enable high-quality image denoising at low computational cost. Our approach is motivated by Noise2Noise and Neighbor2Neighbor and works well for denoising pixel-wise independent noise. Our experiments on artificial, real-world camera, and microscope noise show that our method termed ZS-N2N (Zero Shot Noise2Noise) often outperforms existing dataset-free methods at a reduced cost, making it suitable for use cases with scarce data availability and limited compute resources.

{"title":"Opportunities and Challenges to Integrate Artificial Intelligence into Manufacturing Systems: Thoughts from a Panel Discussion","description":"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly increase the productivity, quality, and profitability in future manufacturing systems. Traditional mass-production will give way to personalized production, with each item made to order, at the low cost and high-quality consumers have come to expect. Manufacturing systems will have the intelligence to be resilient to multiple disruptions, from small-scale machine breakdowns, to large-scale natural disasters. Products will be made with higher precision and lower variability. While gains have been made towards the development of these factories of the future, many challenges remain to fully realize this vision. To consider the challenges and opportunities associated with this topic, a panel of experts from Industry, Academia, and Government was invited to participate in an active discussion at the 2022 Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC) held in Jersey City, New Jersey from October 3- 5, 2022. The panel discussion focused on the challenges and opportunities to more fully integrate AI into manufacturing systems. Three overarching themes emerged from the panel discussion. First, to be successful, AI will need to work seamlessly, and in an integrated manner with humans (and vice versa). Second, significant gaps in the infrastructure needed to enable the full potential of AI into the manufacturing ecosystem, including sufficient data availability, storage, and analysis, must be addressed. And finally, improved coordination between universities, industry, and government agencies can facilitate greater opportunities to push the field forward.

{"title":"I2Edit: Towards Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing via Dialogue","description":"Although there have been considerable research efforts on controllable facial image editing, the desirable interactive setting where the users can interact with the system to adjust their requirements dynamically hasn't been well explored. This paper focuses on facial image editing via dialogue and introduces a new benchmark dataset, Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing (I2Edit), for evaluating image editing quality and interaction ability in real-world interactive facial editing scenarios. The dataset is constructed upon the CelebA-HQ dataset with images annotated with a multi-turn dialogue that corresponds to the user editing requirements. I2Edit is challenging, as it needs to 1) track the dynamically updated user requirements and edit the images accordingly, as well as 2) generate the appropriate natural language response to communicate with the user. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of a dialogue module and an image editing module. The former is for user edit requirements tracking and generating the corresponding indicative responses, while the latter edits the images conditioned on the tracked user edit requirements. In contrast to previous works that simply treat multi-turn interaction as a sequence of single-turn interactions, we extract the user edit requirements from the whole dialogue history instead of the current single turn. The extracted global user edit requirements enable us to directly edit the input raw image to avoid error accumulation and attribute forgetting issues. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the I2Edit dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework over the previous single-turn methods. We believe our new dataset could serve as a valuable resource to push forward the exploration of real-world, complex interactive image editing. Code and data will be made public.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11108v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"I2Edit: Towards Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing via Dialogue Although there have been considerable research efforts on controllable facial image editing, the desirable interactive setting where the users can interact with the system to adjust their requirements dynamically hasn't been well explored.

{"title":"From Sparse to Precise: A Practical Editing Approach for Intracardiac Echocardiography Segmentation","description":"Accurate and safe catheter ablation procedures for patients with atrial fibrillation require precise segmentation of cardiac structures in Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) imaging. Prior studies have suggested methods that employ 3D geometry information from the ICE transducer to create a sparse ICE volume by placing 2D frames in a 3D grid, enabling training of 3D segmentation models. However, the resulting 3D masks from these models can be inaccurate and may lead to serious clinical complications due to the sparse sampling in ICE data, frames misalignment, and cardiac motion. To address this issue, we propose an interactive editing framework that allows users to edit segmentation output by drawing scribbles on a 2D frame. The user interaction is mapped to the 3D grid and utilized to execute an editing step that modifies the segmentation in the vicinity of the interaction while preserving the previous segmentation away from the interaction. Furthermore, our framework accommodates multiple edits to the segmentation output in a sequential manner without compromising previous edits. This paper presents a novel loss function and a novel evaluation metric specifically designed for editing. Results from cross-validation and testing indicate that our proposed loss function outperforms standard losses and training strategies in terms of segmentation quality and following user input. Additionally, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that subsequent edits do not compromise previous edits when using our method, as opposed to standard segmentation losses. Overall, our approach enhances the accuracy of the segmentation while avoiding undesired changes away from user interactions and without compromising the quality of previously edited regions, leading to better patient outcomes.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11041v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"From Sparse to Precise: A Practical Editing Approach for Intracardiac Echocardiography Segmentation Accurate and safe catheter ablation procedures for patients with atrial fibrillation require precise segmentation of cardiac structures in Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) imaging.

{"title":"LFACon: Introducing Anglewise Attention to No-Reference Quality Assessment in Light Field Space","description":"Light field imaging can capture both the intensity information and the direction information of light rays. It naturally enables a six-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual reality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment (LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but also the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of metrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular quality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics suffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of \"anglewise attention\" by introducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an LFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose three new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid attention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize angular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively, and reduce the computational cost of feature extraction. By effectively incorporating the proposed kernels, we further propose our light field attentional convolutional neural network (LFACon) as an LFIQA metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed LFACon metric significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art LFIQA metrics. For the majority of distortion types, LFACon attains the best performance with lower complexity and less computational time.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10961v1","created":"2023-03-20","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"LFACon: Introducing Anglewise Attention to No-Reference Quality Assessment in Light Field Space Light field imaging can capture both the intensity information and the direction information of light rays.

So could anyone suggest papers on transductive learning which you think that I should not miss out?\n\nAlso I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but, there is something which I'm struggling with recently. I have to conduct my literature review but it's too difficult really. And it takes too long to understand an article. Do you guys also have some suggestions on how I could read an article more efficiently so that I could read multiple articles in a single day?","classes":{"dataset":0.4116801918,"prompteng":0.1310380399}}

{"title":"3D-POP -- An automated annotation approach to facilitate markerless 2D-3D tracking of freely moving birds with marker-based motion capture","description":"Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing the field of animal behavior by enabling researchers to track the poses and locations of freely moving animals without any marker attachment. However, large datasets of annotated images of animals for markerless pose tracking, especially high-resolution images taken from multiple angles with accurate 3D annotations, are still scant. Here, we propose a method that uses a motion capture (mo-cap) system to obtain a large amount of annotated data on animal movement and posture (2D and 3D) in a semi-automatic manner. Our method is novel in that it extracts the 3D positions of morphological keypoints (e.g eyes, beak, tail) in reference to the positions of markers attached to the animals. Using this method, we obtained, and offer here, a new dataset - 3D-POP with approximately 300k annotated frames (4 million instances) in the form of videos having groups of one to ten freely moving birds from 4 different camera views in a 3.6m x 4.2m area. 3D-POP is the first dataset of flocking birds with accurate keypoint annotations in 2D and 3D along with bounding box and individual identities and will facilitate the development of solutions for problems of 2D to 3D markerless pose, trajectory tracking, and identification in birds.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13174v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"3D-POP -- An automated annotation approach to facilitate markerless 2D-3D tracking of freely moving birds with marker-based motion capture Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing the field of animal behavior by enabling researchers to track the poses and locations of freely moving animals without any marker attachment.

{"title":"Modeling Entities as Semantic Points for Visual Information Extraction in the Wild","description":"Recently, Visual Information Extraction (VIE) has been becoming increasingly important in both the academia and industry, due to the wide range of real-world applications. Previously, numerous works have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, the benchmarks used to assess these methods are relatively plain, i.e., scenarios with real-world complexity are not fully represented in these benchmarks. As the first contribution of this work, we curate and release a new dataset for VIE, in which the document images are much more challenging in that they are taken from real applications, and difficulties such as blur, partial occlusion, and printing shift are quite common. All these factors may lead to failures in information extraction. Therefore, as the second contribution, we explore an alternative approach to precisely and robustly extract key information from document images under such tough conditions. Specifically, in contrast to previous methods, which usually either incorporate visual information into a multi-modal architecture or train text spotting and information extraction in an end-to-end fashion, we explicitly model entities as semantic points, i.e., center points of entities are enriched with semantic information describing the attributes and relationships of different entities, which could largely benefit entity labeling and linking. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks in this field as well as the proposed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly enhanced performance on entity labeling and linking, compared with previous state-of-the-art models.

{"title":"Learning a Practical SDR-to-HDRTV Up-conversion using New Dataset and Degradation Models","description":"In media industry, the demand of SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion arises when users possess HDR-WCG (high dynamic range-wide color gamut) TVs while most off-the-shelf footage is still in SDR (standard dynamic range). The research community has started tackling this low-level vision task by learning-based approaches. When applied to real SDR, yet, current methods tend to produce dim and desaturated result, making nearly no improvement on viewing experience. Different from other network-oriented methods, we attribute such deficiency to training set (HDR-SDR pair). Consequently, we propose new HDRTV dataset (dubbed HDRTV4K) and new HDR-to-SDR degradation models.

The research community has started tackling this low-level vision task by learning-based approaches. When applied to real SDR, yet, current methods tend to produce dim and desaturated result, making nearly no improvement on viewing experience.

{"title":"Backdoor Defense via Adaptively Splitting Poisoned Dataset","description":"Backdoor defenses have been studied to alleviate the threat of deep neural networks (DNNs) being backdoor attacked and thus maliciously altered. Since DNNs usually adopt some external training data from an untrusted third party, a robust backdoor defense strategy during the training stage is of importance.

In this work, we summarize the training-time defenses from a unified framework as splitting the poisoned dataset into two data pools. Under our framework, we propose an adaptively splitting dataset-based defense (ASD). Concretely, we apply loss-guided split and meta-learning-inspired split to dynamically update two data pools. With the split clean data pool and polluted data pool, ASD successfully defends against backdoor attacks during training.

{"title":"Medical diffusion on a budget: textual inversion for medical image generation","description":"Diffusion-based models for text-to-image generation have gained immense popularity due to recent advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and quality. Although it is becoming increasingly feasible to perform inference with these systems using consumer-grade GPUs, training them from scratch still requires access to large datasets and significant computational resources. In the case of medical image generation, the availability of large, publicly accessible datasets that include text reports is limited due to legal and ethical concerns. While training a diffusion model on a private dataset may address this issue, it is not always feasible for institutions lacking the necessary computational resources. This work demonstrates that pre-trained Stable Diffusion models, originally trained on natural images, can be adapted to various medical imaging modalities by training text embeddings with textual inversion. In this study, we conducted experiments using medical datasets comprising only 100 samples from three medical modalities. Embeddings were trained in a matter of hours, while still retaining diagnostic relevance in image generation. Experiments were designed to achieve several objectives. Firstly, we fine-tuned the training and inference processes of textual inversion, revealing that larger embeddings and more examples are required. Secondly, we validated our approach by demonstrating a 2\\% increase in the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, which is a challenging multi-modal imaging modality, from 0.78 to 0.80. Thirdly, we performed simulations by interpolating between healthy and diseased states, combining multiple pathologies, and inpainting to show embedding flexibility and control of disease appearance.

{"title":"A Generalised Deep Meta-Learning Model for Automated Quality Control of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Images","description":"Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a powerful modality in functional and anatomical assessment for various cardiovascular diseases. Sufficient image quality is essential to achieve proper diagnosis and treatment. A large number of medical images, the variety of imaging artefacts, and the workload of imaging centres are among the things that reveal the necessity of automatic image quality assessment (IQA). However, automated IQA requires access to bulk annotated datasets for training deep learning (DL) models. Labelling medical images is a tedious, costly and time-consuming process, which creates a fundamental challenge in proposing DL-based methods for medical applications. This study aims to present a new method for CMR IQA when there is limited access to annotated datasets. Methods: The proposed generalised deep meta-learning model can evaluate the quality by learning tasks in the prior stage and then fine-tuning the resulting model on a small labelled dataset of the desired tasks. This model was evaluated on the data of over 6,000 subjects from the UK Biobank for five defined tasks, including detecting respiratory motion, cardiac motion, Aliasing and Gibbs ringing artefacts and images without artefacts. Results: The results of extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model. Besides, comparing the model's accuracy with the domain adaptation model indicates a significant difference by using only 64 annotated images related to the desired tasks.

Specifically, saliency object detection is applied to the original generated image, and the minimum enclosing box is used for cropping the main object based on the saliency map. After that, the cropped object is randomly pasted on the image, which comes from the base dataset. We also study the influence of the input text of text-to-image generator and the number of synthetic images used. To construct a representative synthetic training dataset, we maximize the diversity of the selected images via a sample-based and cluster-based method.

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4.

The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth.

By investigating the adversarial effects of highly threatening attacks, including property inference, data reconstruction, and feature hijacking attacks, we identify the underlying vulnerability of SplitNN and propose a countermeasure.

To this end, we propose a new activation function named R3eLU, transferring private smashed data and partial loss into randomized responses in forward and backward propagations, respectively. We give the first attempt to secure split learning against three threatening attacks and present a fine-grained privacy budget allocation scheme.

This complexity severely affects users in the developing regions due to slow cellular data connectivity and usage of low-end smartphone devices. Existing solutions to simplify the Web are generally evaluated using several different metrics and settings, which hinders the comparison of these solutions against each other. Hence, it is difficult to select the appropriate solution for a specific context and use case. This paper presents Wasef, a framework that uses a comprehensive set of timing, saving, and quality metrics to evaluate and compare different web complexity solutions in a reproducible manner and under realistic settings. The framework integrates a set of existing state-of-the-art solutions and facilitates the addition of newer solutions down the line. Wasef first creates a cache of web pages by crawling both landing and internal ones. Each page in the cache is then passed through a web complexity solution to generate an optimized version of the page. Finally, each optimized version is evaluated in a consistent manner using a uniform environment and metrics. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to compare and contrast the performance characteristics of different web complexity solutions under realistic conditions. We also show that the accessibility to pages in developing regions can be significantly improved, by evaluating the top 100 global pages in the developed world against the top 100 pages in the lowest 50 developing countries.

{"title":"Density-Insensitive Unsupervised Domain Adaption on 3D Object Detection","description":"3D object detection from point clouds is crucial in safety-critical autonomous driving. Although many works have made great efforts and achieved significant progress on this task, most of them suffer from expensive annotation cost and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap. Recently, few works attempt to tackle the domain gap in objects, but still fail to adapt to the gap of varying beam-densities between two domains, which is critical to mitigate the characteristic differences of the LiDAR collectors. To this end, we make the attempt to propose a density-insensitive domain adaption framework to address the density-induced domain gap. In particular, we first introduce Random Beam Re-Sampling (RBRS) to enhance the robustness of 3D detectors trained on the source domain to the varying beam-density. Then, we take this pre-trained detector as the backbone model, and feed the unlabeled target domain data into our newly designed task-specific teacher-student framework for predicting its high-quality pseudo labels. To further adapt the property of density-insensitivity into the target domain, we feed the teacher and student branches with the same sample of different densities, and propose an Object Graph Alignment (OGA) module to construct two object-graphs between the two branches for enforcing the consistency in both the attribute and relation of cross-density objects. Experimental results on three widely adopted 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed domain adaption method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially over varying-density data.

Although many works have made great efforts and achieved significant progress on this task, most of them suffer from expensive annotation cost and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap. Recently, few works attempt to tackle the domain gap in objects, but still fail to adapt to the gap of varying beam-densities between two domains, which is critical to mitigate the characteristic differences of the LiDAR collectors.

{"title":"Contrastive Learning based Semantic Communication for Wireless Image Transmission","description":"Recently, semantic communication has been widely applied in wireless image transmission systems as it can prioritize the preservation of meaningful semantic information in images over the accuracy of transmitted symbols, leading to improved communication efficiency. However, existing semantic communication approaches still face limitations in achieving considerable inference performance in downstream AI tasks like image recognition, or balancing the inference performance with the quality of the reconstructed image at the receiver. Therefore, this paper proposes a contrastive learning (CL)-based semantic communication approach to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we regard the image corruption during transmission as a form of data augmentation in CL and leverage CL to reduce the semantic distance between the original and the corrupted reconstruction while maintaining the semantic distance among irrelevant images for better discrimination in downstream tasks. Moreover, we design a two-stage training procedure and the corresponding loss functions for jointly optimizing the semantic encoder and decoder to achieve a good trade-off between the performance of image recognition in the downstream task and reconstructed quality. Simulations are finally conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the competitive approaches. In particular, the proposed method can achieve up to 56\\% accuracy gain on the CIFAR10 dataset when the bandwidth compression ratio is 1/48.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09438v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Contrastive Learning based Semantic Communication for Wireless Image Transmission Recently, semantic communication has been widely applied in wireless image transmission systems as it can prioritize the preservation of meaningful semantic information in images over the accuracy of transmitted symbols, leading to improved communication efficiency.

{"title":"ASM: Adaptive Skinning Model for High-Quality 3D Face Modeling","description":"The research fields of parametric face models and 3D face reconstruction have been extensively studied. However, a critical question remains unanswered: how to tailor the face model for specific reconstruction settings. We argue that reconstruction with multi-view uncalibrated images demands a new model with stronger capacity. Our study shifts attention from data-dependent 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to an understudied human-designed skinning model. We propose Adaptive Skinning Model (ASM), which redefines the skinning model with more compact and fully tunable parameters. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ASM achieves significantly improved capacity than 3DMM, with the additional advantage of model size and easy implementation for new topology. We achieve state-of-the-art performance with ASM for multi-view reconstruction on the Florence MICC Coop benchmark. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the importance of a high-capacity model for fully exploiting abundant information from multi-view input in reconstruction. Furthermore, our model with physical-semantic parameters can be directly utilized for real-world applications, such as in-game avatar creation. As a result, our work opens up new research directions for the parametric face models and facilitates future research on multi-view reconstruction.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09423v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"ASM: Adaptive Skinning Model for High-Quality 3D Face Modeling The research fields of parametric face models and 3D face reconstruction have been extensively studied.

{"title":"On Creating a Comprehensive Food Database","description":"Studies with the primary aim of addressing eating disorders focus on assessing the nutrient content of food items with an exclusive focus on caloric intake. There are two primary impediments that can be noted in these studies. The first of these relates to the fact that caloric intake of each food item is calculated from an existing database. The second concerns the scientific significance of caloric intake used as the single measure of nutrient content. By requiring an existing database, researchers are forced to find some source of a comprehensive set of food items as well as their respective nutrients. This search alone is a difficult task, and if completed often leads to the requirement of a paid API service. These services are expensive and non-customizable, taking away funding that could be aimed at other parts of the study only to give an unwieldy database that can not be modified or contributed to. In this work, we introduce a new rendition of the USDA's food database that includes both foods found in grocery stores and those found in restaurants or fast food places. At the moment, we have accumulated roughly 1.5 million food entries consisting of approximately 18,000 brands and 100 restaurants in the United States. These foods also have an abundance of nutrient data associated with them, from the caloric amount to saturated fat levels. The data is stored in MySQL format and is spread among five major tables.

{"title":"Beware of the Unexpected: Bimodal Taint Analysis","description":"Static analysis is a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities and other programming problems. Global taint tracking, in particular, can spot vulnerabilities arising from complicated data flow across multiple functions. However, precisely identifying which flows are problematic is challenging, and sometimes depends on factors beyond the reach of pure program analysis, such as conventions and informal knowledge. For example, learning that a parameter \"name\" of an API function \"locale\" ends up in a file path is surprising and potentially problematic. In contrast, it would be completely unsurprising to find that a parameter \"command\" passed to an API function \"execaCommand\" is eventually interpreted as part of an operating-system command. This paper presents Fluffy, a bimodal taint analysis that combines static analysis, which reasons about data flow, with machine learning, which probabilistically determines which flows are potentially problematic. The key idea is to let machine learning models predict from natural language information involved in a taint flow, such as API names, whether the flow is expected or unexpected, and to inform developers only about the latter. We present a general framework and instantiate it with four learned models, which offer different trade-offs between the need to annotate training data and the accuracy of predictions. We implement Fluffy on top of the CodeQL analysis framework and apply it to 250K JavaScript projects. Evaluating on five common vulnerability types, we find that Fluffy achieves an F1 score of 0.85 or more on four of them across a variety of datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10545v1","created":"2023-01-25","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Beware of the Unexpected: Bimodal Taint Analysis Static analysis is a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities and other programming problems.

We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of whitelist tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of whitelist tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark.

{"title":"Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation for IoT Intrusion Detection: A Geometric Graph Alignment Approach","description":"Data scarcity hinders the usability of data-dependent algorithms when tackling IoT intrusion detection (IID). To address this, we utilise the data rich network intrusion detection (NID) domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for IID domains. In this paper, a Geometric Graph Alignment (GGA) approach is leveraged to mask the geometric heterogeneities between domains for better intrusion knowledge transfer. Specifically, each intrusion domain is formulated as a graph where vertices and edges represent intrusion categories and category-wise interrelationships, respectively. The overall shape is preserved via a confused discriminator incapable to identify adjacency matrices between different intrusion domain graphs. A rotation avoidance mechanism and a centre point matching mechanism is used to avoid graph misalignment due to rotation and symmetry, respectively. Besides, category-wise semantic knowledge is transferred to act as vertex-level alignment. To exploit the target data, a pseudo-label election mechanism that jointly considers network prediction, geometric property and neighbourhood information is used to produce fine-grained pseudo-label assignment. Upon aligning the intrusion graphs geometrically from different granularities, the transferred intrusion knowledge can boost IID performance. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the GGA approach and validate the usefulness of GGA constituting components.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09801v1","created":"2023-01-24","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation for IoT Intrusion Detection: A Geometric Graph Alignment Approach Data scarcity hinders the usability of data-dependent algorithms when tackling IoT intrusion detection (IID).

We show that only 5% attacker nodes are sufficient to perform a backdoor attack with 42% attack success without decreasing the accuracy on clean data by more than 2%. We also demonstrate that the attack can be amplified by the attacker crashing a small number of nodes. We evaluate defenses proposed in the context of centralized federated learning and show they are ineffective in peer-to-peer settings.

This is an important improvement that reduces privacy leakage in comparison to other SL-based works.

We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model, ML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing performance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability patterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases.

Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of classifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into exploit categories.

This approach could be extended to other assured properties, similar to safety, such as security. We conclude with a discussion of the safety considerations that emerge in the context of candidate architectural patterns that have been proposed in the recent literature for enabling autonomy capabilities by integrating AI and ML. A recommendation is made for the generation of a property-driven architectural pattern catalogue.","classes":{"dataset":0.050757993,"prompteng":0.0358179659}}

Recent regulations like the European GDPR provide rules for the processing of personal and sensitive data, like that no such data may be leaked without the consent of the user.   Researchers have proposed sophisticated approaches to track sensitive data within mobile apps, all of which rely on specific lists of sensitive source and sink API methods. The data flow analysis results greatly depend on these lists' quality. Previous approaches either used incomplete hand-written lists that quickly became outdated or relied on machine learning. The latter, however, leads to numerous false positives, as we show.   This paper introduces CoDoC, a tool that aims to revive the machine-learning approach to precisely identify privacy-related source and sink API methods. In contrast to previous approaches, CoDoC uses deep learning techniques and combines the source code with the documentation of API methods. Firstly, we propose novel definitions that clarify the concepts of sensitive source and sink methods.

{"title":"Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage for Cardinality Counting","description":"Several applications require counting the number of distinct items in the data, which is known as the cardinality counting problem.

The low current magnitude and diverse characteristics of HIFs make them difficult to be detected by over-current relays. Recently, data-driven methods based on machine learning models are gaining popularity in HIF detection due to their capability to learn complex patterns from data. Most machine learning-based detection methods adopt supervised learning techniques to distinguish HIFs from normal load conditions by performing classifications, which rely on a large amount of data collected during HIF.

As a result, the reliability and generalization of the classification methods are limited when the load profiles and faults are not present in the training data. Consequently, this paper proposes an unsupervised HIF detection framework using the autoencoder and principal component analysis-based monitoring techniques. The proposed fault detection method detects the HIF by monitoring the changes in correlation structure within the current waveforms that are different from the normal loads. The performance of the proposed HIF detection method is tested using real data collected from a 4.16 kV distribution system and compared with results from a commercially available solution for HIF detection.

{"title":"Backdoor Attacks Against Dataset Distillation","description":"Dataset distillation has emerged as a prominent technique to improve data efficiency when training machine learning models. It encapsulates the knowledge from a large dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset. A model trained on this smaller distilled dataset can attain comparable performance to a model trained on the original training dataset. However, the existing dataset distillation techniques mainly aim at achieving the best trade-off between resource usage efficiency and model utility. The security risks stemming from them have not been explored. This study performs the first backdoor attack against the models trained on the data distilled by dataset distillation models in the image domain. Concretely, we inject triggers into the synthetic data during the distillation procedure rather than during the model training stage, where all previous attacks are performed. We propose two types of backdoor attacks, namely NAIVEATTACK and DOORPING. NAIVEATTACK simply adds triggers to the raw data at the initial distillation phase, while DOORPING iteratively updates the triggers during the entire distillation procedure. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, architectures, and dataset distillation techniques.

It encapsulates the knowledge from a large dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset. A model trained on this smaller distilled dataset can attain comparable performance to a model trained on the original training dataset. However, the existing dataset distillation techniques mainly aim at achieving the best trade-off between resource usage efficiency and model utility. The security risks stemming from them have not been explored. This study performs the first backdoor attack against the models trained on the data distilled by dataset distillation models in the image domain. Concretely, we inject triggers into the synthetic data during the distillation procedure rather than during the model training stage, where all previous attacks are performed. We propose two types of backdoor attacks, namely NAIVEATTACK and DOORPING. NAIVEATTACK simply adds triggers to the raw data at the initial distillation phase, while DOORPING iteratively updates the triggers during the entire distillation procedure. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, architectures, and dataset distillation techniques. Empirical evaluation shows that NAIVEATTACK achieves decent attack success rate (ASR) scores in some cases, while DOORPING reaches higher ASR scores (close to 1.0) in all cases.

{"title":"Look, Listen, and Attack: Backdoor Attacks Against Video Action Recognition","description":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to a class of attacks called \"backdoor attacks\", which create an association between a backdoor trigger and a target label the attacker is interested in exploiting. A backdoored DNN performs well on clean test images, yet persistently predicts an attacker-defined label for any sample in the presence of the backdoor trigger. Although backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in the image domain, there are very few works that explore such attacks in the video domain, and they tend to conclude that image backdoor attacks are less effective in the video domain. In this work, we revisit the traditional backdoor threat model and incorporate additional video-related aspects to that model. We show that poisoned-label image backdoor attacks could be extended temporally in two ways, statically and dynamically, leading to highly effective attacks in the video domain. In addition, we explore natural video backdoors to highlight the seriousness of this vulnerability in the video domain. And, for the first time, we study multi-modal (audiovisual) backdoor attacks against video action recognition models, where we show that attacking a single modality is enough for achieving a high attack success rate.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00986v2","created":"2023-01-03","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Look, Listen, and Attack: Backdoor Attacks Against Video Action Recognition Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to a class of attacks called \"backdoor attacks\", which create an association between a backdoor trigger and a target label the attacker is interested in exploiting.

{"title":"Measuring and Estimating Key Quality Indicators in Cloud Gaming services","description":"User equipment is one of the main bottlenecks facing the gaming industry nowadays. The extremely realistic games which are currently available trigger high computational requirements of the user devices to run games.

To this end, games are hosted on remote servers, relegating users' devices to play only the role of a peripheral for interacting with the game. However, this paradigm overloads the communication links connecting the users with the cloud. Therefore, service experience becomes highly dependent on network connectivity. To overcome this, Cloud Gaming will be boosted by the promised performance of 5G and future 6G networks, together with the flexibility provided by mobility in multi-RAT scenarios, such as WiFi.

{"title":"Learning Latent Representations to Co-Adapt to Humans","description":"When robots interact with humans in homes, roads, or factories the human's behavior often changes in response to the robot. Non-stationary humans are challenging for robot learners: actions the robot has learned to coordinate with the original human may fail after the human adapts to the robot. In this paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that enables robots (i.e., ego agents) to co-adapt alongside dynamic humans (i.e., other agents) using only the robot's low-level states, actions, and rewards. A core challenge is that humans not only react to the robot's behavior, but the way in which humans react inevitably changes both over time and between users. To deal with this challenge, our insight is that -- instead of building an exact model of the human -- robots can learn and reason over high-level representations of the human's policy and policy dynamics. Applying this insight we develop RILI: Robustly Influencing Latent Intent. RILI first embeds low-level robot observations into predictions of the human's latent strategy and strategy dynamics. Next, RILI harnesses these predictions to select actions that influence the adaptive human towards advantageous, high reward behaviors over repeated interactions. We demonstrate that -- given RILI's measured performance with users sampled from an underlying distribution -- we can probabilistically bound RILI's expected performance across new humans sampled from the same distribution. Our simulated experiments compare RILI to state-of-the-art representation and reinforcement learning baselines, and show that RILI better learns to coordinate with imperfect, noisy, and time-varying agents.

Moreover it only requires little human data, thus compatible with the constraints of modern video game production. This novel agent could be used to investigate behaviors and balancing during the production of a video game with a realistic amount of training time.","classes":{"dataset":0.1093890145,"prompteng":0.0038637614}}
{"title":"Zero-Sum Stochastic Stackelberg Games","description":"Zero-sum stochastic games have found important applications in a variety of fields, from machine learning to economics. Work on this model has primarily focused on the computation of Nash equilibrium due to its effectiveness in solving adversarial board and video games. Unfortunately, a Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist in zero-sum stochastic games when the payoffs at each state are not convex-concave in the players' actions. A Stackelberg equilibrium, however, is guaranteed to exist. Consequently, in this paper, we study zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games. Going beyond known existence results for (non-stationary) Stackelberg equilibria, we prove the existence of recursive (i.e., Markov perfect) Stackelberg equilibria (recSE) in these games, provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a policy profile to be a recSE, and show that recSE can be computed in (weakly) polynomial time via value iteration. Finally, we show that zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games can model the problem of pricing and allocating goods across agents and time. More specifically, we propose a zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg game whose recSE correspond to the recursive competitive equilibria of a large class of stochastic Fisher markets. We close with a series of experiments that showcase how our methodology can be used to solve the consumption-savings problem in stochastic Fisher markets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13847v1","created":"2022-11-25","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Zero-Sum Stochastic Stackelberg Games Zero-sum stochastic games have found important applications in a variety of fields, from machine learning to economics.

{"title":"Preference-Learning Emitters for Mixed-Initiative Quality-Diversity Algorithms","description":"In mixed-initiative co-creation tasks, where a human and a machine jointly create items, it is valuable for the generative system to provide multiple relevant suggestions to the designer. Quality-diversity algorithms have been commonly used for this, as they can provide diverse suggestions that are representative of salient areas of the solution space, showcasing solutions with both high fitness and different properties that the designer might be interested in. Since these suggestions are what drives the search process, it is important that they provide the right inspiration for the designer, as well as not stray too far away from the search trajectory, i.e., they should be aligned with what the designer is looking for. Additionally, in most cases, many interactions with the system are required before the designer is content with a solution. In this work, we tackle both of these problems with an interactive constrained MAP-Elites system by crafting emitters that are able to learn the preferences of the designer and use them in automated hidden steps. By learning such preferences, we remain aligned with the designer's intentions, and by applying automatic steps, we generate more solutions per system interaction, giving a larger number of choices to the designer and speeding up the search process. We propose a general framework for preference-learning emitters and test it on a procedural content generation task in the video game Space Engineers.

{"title":"Solving Royal Game of Ur Using Reinforcement Learning","description":"Reinforcement Learning has recently surfaced as a very powerful tool to solve complex problems in the domain of board games, wherein an agent is generally required to learn complex strategies and moves based on its own experiences and rewards received. While RL has outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods used for playing simple video games and popular board games, it is yet to demonstrate its capability on ancient games.

{"title":"Learning with Combinatorial Optimization Layers: a Probabilistic Approach","description":"Combinatorial optimization (CO) layers in machine learning (ML) pipelines are a powerful tool to tackle data-driven decision tasks, but they come with two main challenges. First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a piecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML pipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence of slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not work well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these challenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained implementations slows down the adoption of CO layers.   In this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic perspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate differentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many approaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones. Based on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source Julia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into a differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines containing such layers. Our library works with arbitrary optimization algorithms, and it is fully compatible with Julia's ML ecosystem. We demonstrate its abilities using a pathfinding problem on video game maps as guiding example, as well as three other applications from operations research.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13513v2","created":"2022-07-27","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Learning with Combinatorial Optimization Layers: a Probabilistic Approach Combinatorial optimization (CO) layers in machine learning (ML) pipelines are a powerful tool to tackle data-driven decision tasks, but they come with two main challenges.

{"title":"A framework for online, stabilizing reinforcement learning","description":"Online reinforcement learning is concerned with training an agent on-the-fly via dynamic interaction with the environment. Here, due to the specifics of the application, it is not generally possible to perform long pre-training, as it is commonly done in off-line, model-free approaches, which are akin to dynamic programming. Such applications may be found more frequently in industry, rather than in pure digital fields, such as cloud services, video games, database management, etc., where reinforcement learning has been demonstrating success. Online reinforcement learning, in contrast, is more akin to classical control, which utilizes some model knowledge about the environment. Stability of the closed-loop (agent plus the environment) is a major challenge for such online approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by a special fusion of online reinforcement learning with elements of classical control, namely, based on the Lyapunov theory of stability. The idea is to start the agent at once, without pre-training, and learn approximately optimal policy under specially designed constraints, which guarantee stability. The resulting approach was tested in an extensive experimental study with a mobile robot. A nominal parking controller was used as a baseline. It was observed that the suggested agent could always successfully park the robot, while significantly improving the cost.

Depth map streaming is often necessary when such operations are performed in a distributed system and it requires in most cases fast performing compression, which is why video codecs are often used. Hardware implementations of standard video codecs enable relatively high resolution and framerate combinations, even on resource constrained devices, but unfortunately those implementations do not currently support RGB+depth extensions. However, they can be used for depth compression by first packing the depth maps into RGB or YUV frames. We investigate depth map compression using a combination of depth map packing followed by encoding with a standard video codec. We show that the precision at which depth maps are packed has a large and nontrivial impact on the resulting error caused by the combination of the packing scheme and lossy compression when bitrate is constrained. Consequently, we propose a variable precision packing scheme assisted by a neural network model that predicts the optimal precision for each depth map given a bitrate constraint.

{"title":"Short-Term Plasticity Neurons Learning to Learn and Forget","description":"Short-term plasticity (STP) is a mechanism that stores decaying memories in synapses of the cerebral cortex. In computing practice, STP has been used, but mostly in the niche of spiking neurons, even though theory predicts that it is the optimal solution to certain dynamic tasks. Here we present a new type of recurrent neural unit, the STP Neuron (STPN), which indeed turns out strikingly powerful. Its key mechanism is that synapses have a state, propagated through time by a self-recurrent connection-within-the-synapse. This formulation enables training the plasticity with backpropagation through time, resulting in a form of learning to learn and forget in the short term. The STPN outperforms all tested alternatives, i.e. RNNs, LSTMs, other models with fast weights, and differentiable plasticity. We confirm this in both supervised and reinforcement learning (RL), and in tasks such as Associative Retrieval, Maze Exploration, Atari video games, and MuJoCo robotics. Moreover, we calculate that, in neuromorphic or biological circuits, the STPN minimizes energy consumption across models, as it depresses individual synapses dynamically. Based on these, biological STP may have been a strong evolutionary attractor that maximizes both efficiency and computational power.

In this survey, we take a review of MBRL with a focus on the recent progress in deep RL. For non-tabular environments, there is always a generalization error between the learned environment model and the real environment. As such, it is of great importance to analyze the discrepancy between policy training in the environment model and that in the real environment, which in turn guides the algorithm design for better model learning, model usage, and policy training.

{"title":"DraftRec: Personalized Draft Recommendation for Winning in Multi-Player Online Battle Arena Games","description":"This paper presents a personalized character recommendation system for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games which are considered as one of the most popular online video game genres around the world. When playing MOBA games, players go through a draft stage, where they alternately select a virtual character to play. When drafting, players select characters by not only considering their character preferences, but also the synergy and competence of their team's character combination. However, the complexity of drafting induces difficulties for beginners to choose the appropriate characters based on the characters of their team while considering their own champion preferences. To alleviate this problem, we propose DraftRec, a novel hierarchical model which recommends characters by considering each player's champion preferences and the interaction between the players. DraftRec consists of two networks: the player network and the match network. The player network captures the individual player's champion preference, and the match network integrates the complex relationship between the players and their respective champions. We train and evaluate our model from a manually collected 280,000 matches of League of Legends and a publicly available 50,000 matches of Dota2. Empirically, our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in character recommendation and match outcome prediction task.

Recent advances in machine learning, specifically the application of convolutional neural networks to image analysis, have enabled rapid and accurate segmentation of image data.

Manual testing is a very labor-intensive process, and therefore quickly becomes cost prohibitive. Using scripts for automated testing is affordable, however scripts are ineffective in non-deterministic environments, and knowing when to run each test is another problem altogether. The modern game's complexity, scope, and player expectations are rapidly increasing where quality control is a big portion of the production cost and delivery risk. Reducing this risk and making production happen is a big challenge for the industry currently. To keep production costs realistic up-to and after release, we are focusing on preventive quality assurance tactics alongside testing and data analysis automation. We present SUPERNOVA (Selection of tests and Universal defect Prevention in External Repositories for Novel Objective Verification of software Anomalies), a system responsible for test selection and defect prevention while also functioning as an automation hub. By integrating data analysis functionality with machine and deep learning capability, SUPERNOVA assists quality assurance testers in finding bugs and developers in reducing defects, which improves stability during the production cycle and keeps testing costs under control. The direct impact of this has been observed to be a reduction in 55% or more testing hours for an undisclosed sports game title that has shipped, which was using these test selection optimizations. Furthermore, using risk scores generated by a semi-supervised machine learning model, we are able to detect with 71% precision and 77% recall the probability of a change-list being bug inducing, and provide a detailed breakdown of this inference to developers.

Automated testing of such programs is an important prerequisite for supporting debugging, providing hints, or assessing learning outcomes. However, writing tests for Scratch programs can be challenging: The game-like and randomised nature of typical Scratch programs makes it difficult to identify specific timed input sequences used to control the programs. Furthermore, precise test assertions to check the resulting program states are incompatible with the fundamental principle of creative freedom in programming in Scratch, where correct program behaviour may be implemented with deviations in the graphical appearance or timing of the program.

Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia, monotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress patterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to detect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and neurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to detect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers on our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from Stanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of autistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random Forest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model achieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying children's audio as either ASD or NT.

{"title":"Bayesian Learning of Play Styles in Multiplayer Video Games","description":"The complexity of game play in online multiplayer games has generated strong interest in modeling the different play styles or strategies used by players for success. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian regression approach for the online multiplayer game Battlefield 3 where performance is modeled as a function of the roles, game type, and map taken on by that player in each of their matches. We use a Dirichlet process prior that enables the clustering of players that have similar player-specific coefficients in our regression model, which allows us to discover common play styles amongst our sample of Battlefield 3 players. This Bayesian semi-parametric clustering approach has several advantages: the number of common play styles do not need to be specified, players can move between multiple clusters, and the resulting groupings often have a straight-forward interpretations. We examine the most common play styles among Battlefield 3 players in detail and find groups of players that exhibit overall high performance, as well as groupings of players that perform particularly well in specific game types, maps and roles. We are also able to differentiate between players that are stable members of a particular play style from hybrid players that exhibit multiple play styles across their matches.

The simulation results show that from the global perspective of the prediction model, characteristics such as the quality of academic partners, the seating position in classroom, the dormitory study atmosphere, the English scores of the college entrance examination, the quantity of academic partners, the addiction level of video games, the mobility of academic partners, and the degree of truancy are the best 8 predictors for academic risk.

{"title":"First steps on Gamification of Lung Fluid Cells Annotations in the Flower Domain","description":"Annotating data, especially in the medical domain, requires expert knowledge and a lot of effort. This limits the amount and/or usefulness of available medical data sets for experimentation. Therefore, developing strategies to increase the number of annotations while lowering the needed domain knowledge is of interest. A possible strategy is the use of gamification, i.e. transforming the annotation task into a game. We propose an approach to gamify the task of annotating lung fluid cells from pathological whole slide images (WSIs). As the domain is unknown to non-expert annotators, we transform images of cells to the domain of flower images using a CycleGAN architecture. In this more assessable domain, non-expert annotators can be (t)asked to annotate different kinds of flowers in a playful setting. In order to provide a proof of concept, this work shows that the domain transfer is possible by evaluating an image classification network trained on real cell images and tested on the cell images generated by the CycleGAN network (reconstructed cell images) as well as real cell images. The classification network reaches an average accuracy of 94.73 % on the original lung fluid cells and 95.25 % on the transformed lung fluid cells, respectively.

{"title":"Learning from demonstrations with SACR2: Soft Actor-Critic with Reward Relabeling","description":"During recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made successful incursions into complex decision-making applications such as robotics, autonomous driving or video games. Off-policy algorithms tend to be more sample-efficient than their on-policy counterparts, and can additionally benefit from any off-policy data stored in the replay buffer. Expert demonstrations are a popular source for such data: the agent is exposed to successful states and actions early on, which can accelerate the learning process and improve performance. In the past, multiple ideas have been proposed to make good use of the demonstrations in the buffer, such as pretraining on demonstrations only or minimizing additional cost functions. We carry on a study to evaluate several of these ideas in isolation, to see which of them have the most significant impact. We also present a new method for sparse-reward tasks, based on a reward bonus given to demonstrations and successful episodes. First, we give a reward bonus to the transitions coming from demonstrations to encourage the agent to match the demonstrated behaviour. Then, upon collecting a successful episode, we relabel its transitions with the same bonus before adding them to the replay buffer, encouraging the agent to also match its previous successes. The base algorithm for our experiments is the popular Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), a state-of-the-art off-policy algorithm for continuous action spaces. Our experiments focus on manipulation robotics, specifically on a 3D reaching task for a robotic arm in simulation. We show that our method SACR2 based on reward relabeling improves the performance on this task, even in the absence of demonstrations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14464v2","created":"2021-10-27","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Learning from demonstrations with SACR2: Soft Actor-Critic with Reward Relabeling During recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made successful incursions into complex decision-making applications such as robotics, autonomous driving or video games.

To answer this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task and the associated SMART-101 dataset, for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed specifically for children in the 6-8 age group. Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including arithmetic, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To scale our dataset towards training deep neural networks, we programmatically generate entirely new instances for each puzzle while retaining their solution algorithm. To benchmark the performance on the SMART-101 dataset, we propose a vision and language meta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbone neural networks.

{"title":"Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries via Large Language Models","description":"Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries is critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness and safety for the end users. As such, researchers have started developing various fuzzing or testing techniques targeting DL libraries. Previous work can be mainly classified into API-level fuzzing and model-level fuzzing. However, both types of techniques cannot detect bugs that can only be exposed by complex API sequences - API-level fuzzers cannot cover API sequences, while model-level fuzzers can only cover specific API sequence patterns and a small subset of APIs due to complicated input/shape constraints for tensor computations. To address these limitations, we propose LLMFuzz - the first automated approach to directly leveraging Large Pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are trained on billions of code snippets and can autoregressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key insight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL library APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn the intricate DL API constraints and directly generate/mutate valid DL programs for fuzzing DL libraries. More specifically, we first directly use a generative LLM (e.g., Codex) to generate highquality seed programs based on input prompts. Then, we leverage an evolutionary fuzzing loop which applies an infilling LLM (e.g., InCoder) to further perform small mutations on the seed programs to generate more diverse API sequences for fuzzing DL libraries.

{"title":"ReCode: Robustness Evaluation of Code Generation Models","description":"Code generation models have achieved impressive performance. However, they tend to be brittle as slight edits to a prompt could lead to very different generations; these robustness properties, critical for user experience when deployed in real-life applications, are not well understood. Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in code generation. In this paper, we propose ReCode, a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark for code generation models. We customize over 30 transformations specifically for code on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format.

To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise.

{"title":"Scale invariance in X-ray flares of gamma-ray bursts","description":"X-ray flares are generally believed to be produced by the reactivation of the central engine, and may have the same energy dissipation mechanism as the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). X-ray flares can therefore provide important clues to understanding the nature of the central engines of GRBs. In this work, we study for the first time the physical connection between differential size and return distributions of X-ray flares of GRBs with known redshifts. We find that the differential distributions of duration, energy, and waiting time can be well fitted by a power-law function. In particular, the distributions for the differences of durations, energies, and waiting times at different times (i.e., the return distributions) well follow a $q$-Gaussian form. The $q$ values in the $q$-Gaussian distributions remain nearly steady for different temporal interval scales, implying a scale-invariant structure of GRB X-ray flares. Moreover, we verify that the $q$ parameters are related to the power-law indices $\\alpha$ of the differential size distributions, characterized as $q=(\\alpha+2)/\\alpha$.

{"title":"Beyond Prompting: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Zero-shot Learners by Clustering Representations","description":"Recent work has demonstrated that pre-trained language models (PLMs) are zero-shot learners. However, most existing zero-shot methods involve heavy human engineering or complicated self-training pipelines, hindering their application to new situations. In this work, we show that zero-shot text classification can be improved simply by clustering texts in the embedding spaces of PLMs. Specifically, we fit the unlabeled texts with a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model after initializing cluster positions and shapes using class names. Despite its simplicity, this approach achieves superior or comparable performance on both topic and sentiment classification datasets and outperforms prior works significantly on unbalanced datasets. We further explore the applicability of our clustering approach by evaluating it on 14 datasets with more diverse topics, text lengths, and numbers of classes. Our approach achieves an average of 20% absolute improvement over prompt-based zero-shot learning. Finally, we compare different PLM embedding spaces and find that texts are well-clustered by topics even if the PLM is not explicitly pre-trained to generate meaningful sentence embeddings.

In order to perform an unambiguous physical modelling of observations, a clear identification of the emission mechanism is needed. An instance of a clear identification is the synchrotron emission during the very strong flare in GRB160821A, that occurs during the prompt phase at 135 s. Here we show that the distribution of the radiating electrons in this flare is initially very narrow, but later develops a power-law tail of accelerated electrons. We thus identify for the first time the onset of particle acceleration in a GRB jet. The flare is consistent with a late energy release from the central engine causing an external-shock as it encounters a preexisting ring nebula of a progenitor Wolf-Rayet star. Relativistic forward and reverse shocks develop, leading to two distinct emission zones with similar properties. The particle acceleration only occurs in the forward shock, moving into the dense nebula matter.

Academic research has identified, quantified and mitigated biases present in language models but is rarely tailored to downstream tasks where wider impact on individuals and society can be felt. In this work, we leverage one popular generative language model, GPT-3, with the goal of writing unbiased and realistic job advertisements. We first assess the bias and realism of zero-shot generated advertisements and compare them to real-world advertisements. We then evaluate prompt-engineering and fine-tuning as debiasing methods.

In this work, we leverage one popular generative language model, GPT-3, with the goal of writing unbiased and realistic job advertisements. We first assess the bias and realism of zero-shot generated advertisements and compare them to real-world advertisements. We then evaluate prompt-engineering and fine-tuning as debiasing methods.

{"title":"Face Recognition in the age of CLIP & Billion image datasets","description":"CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models developed by OpenAI have achieved outstanding results on various image recognition and retrieval tasks, displaying strong zero-shot performance. This means that they are able to perform effectively on tasks for which they have not been explicitly trained.

The LAION-5B dataset also released an approximate nearest neighbor index, with a web interface for search & subset creation.   In this paper, we evaluate the performance of various CLIP models as zero-shot face recognizers. Our findings show that CLIP models perform well on face recognition tasks, but increasing the size of the CLIP model does not necessarily lead to improved accuracy.

{"title":"SegViz: A Federated Learning Framework for Medical Image Segmentation from Distributed Datasets with Different and Incomplete Annotations","description":"Segmentation is one of the primary tasks in the application of deep learning in medical imaging, owing to its multiple downstream clinical applications. As a result, many large-scale segmentation datasets have been curated and released for the segmentation of different anatomical structures. However, these datasets focus on the segmentation of a subset of anatomical structures in the body, therefore, training a model for each dataset would potentially result in hundreds of models and thus limit their clinical translational utility. Furthermore, many of these datasets share the same field of view but have different subsets of annotations, thus making individual dataset annotations incomplete. To that end, we developed SegViz, a federated learning framework for aggregating knowledge from distributed medical image segmentation datasets with different and incomplete annotations into a `global` meta-model. The SegViz framework was trained to build a single model capable of segmenting both liver and spleen aggregating knowledge from both these nodes by aggregating the weights after every 10 epochs. The global SegViz model was tested on an external dataset, Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV), comprising both liver and spleen annotations using the dice similarity (DS) metric. The baseline individual segmentation models for spleen and liver trained on their respective datasets produced a DS score of 0.834 and 0.878 on the BTCV test set. In comparison, the SegViz model produced comparable mean DS scores of 0.829 and 0.899 for the segmentation of the spleen and liver respectively.

Predicting mortality risk and identifying modifiable risk factors based on the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) collected along with the follow-up visits are of great importance for personalized medicine and early intervention. Here, our objective is to develop a deep learning model for a real-time, individualized, and interpretable mortality prediction model - AICare.

{"title":"Bike Frames: Understanding the Implicit Portrayal of Cyclists in the News","description":"Increasing the number of cyclists, whether for general transport or recreation, can provide health improvements and reduce the environmental impact of vehicular transportation. However, the public's perception of cycling may be driven by the ideologies and reporting standards of news agencies. For instance, people may identify cyclists on the road as \"dangerous\" if news agencies overly report cycling accidents, limiting the number of people that cycle for transportation. Moreover, if fewer people cycle, there may be less funding from the government to invest in safe infrastructure. In this paper, we explore the perceived perception of cyclists within news headlines. To accomplish this, we introduce a new dataset, \"Bike Frames\", that can help provide insight into how headlines portray cyclists and help detect accident-related headlines. Next, we introduce a multi-task (MT) regularization approach that increases the detection accuracy of accident-related posts, demonstrating improvements over traditional MT frameworks. Finally, we compare and contrast the perceptions of cyclists with motorcyclist-related headlines to ground the findings with another related activity for both male- and female-related posts. Our findings show that general news websites are more likely to report accidents about cyclists than other events. Moreover, cyclist-specific websites are more likely to report about accidents than motorcycling-specific websites, even though there is more potential danger for motorcyclists. Finally, we show substantial differences in the reporting about male vs. female-related persons, e.g., more male-related cyclists headlines are related to accidents, but more female-related motorcycling headlines about accidents.

Moreover, if fewer people cycle, there may be less funding from the government to invest in safe infrastructure. In this paper, we explore the perceived perception of cyclists within news headlines. To accomplish this, we introduce a new dataset, \"Bike Frames\", that can help provide insight into how headlines portray cyclists and help detect accident-related headlines. Next, we introduce a multi-task (MT) regularization approach that increases the detection accuracy of accident-related posts, demonstrating improvements over traditional MT frameworks. Finally, we compare and contrast the perceptions of cyclists with motorcyclist-related headlines to ground the findings with another related activity for both male- and female-related posts. Our findings show that general news websites are more likely to report accidents about cyclists than other events. Moreover, cyclist-specific websites are more likely to report about accidents than motorcycling-specific websites, even though there is more potential danger for motorcyclists. Finally, we show substantial differences in the reporting about male vs. female-related persons, e.g., more male-related cyclists headlines are related to accidents, but more female-related motorcycling headlines about accidents. WARNING: This paper contains descriptions of accidents and death.","classes":{"dataset":0.0160139482,"prompteng":0.0044467794}}
{"title":"Learning Sparse Temporal Video Mapping for Action Quality Assessment in Floor Gymnastics","description":"Athlete performance measurement in sports videos requires modeling long sequences since the entire spatio-temporal progression contributes dominantly to the performance. It is crucial to comprehend local discriminative spatial dependencies and global semantics for accurate evaluation. However, existing benchmark datasets mainly incorporate sports where the performance lasts only a few seconds. Consequently, state-ofthe-art sports quality assessment methods specifically focus on spatial structure. Although they achieve high performance in short-term sports, they are unable to model prolonged video sequences and fail to achieve similar performance in long-term sports. To facilitate such analysis, we introduce a new dataset, coined AGF-Olympics, that incorporates artistic gymnastic floor routines. AFG-Olympics provides highly challenging scenarios with extensive background, viewpoint, and scale variations over an extended sample duration of up to 2 minutes. In addition, we propose a discriminative attention module to map the dense feature space into a sparse representation by disentangling complex associations.

The variance and mixing weight of the Laplacian component of the signal are analyzed with respect to the type of muscle, type of muscle contraction, dumb-bell weight and training experience of the subjects. The sEMG variance (the Laplacian component) increases with respect to the weights, is greater for isotonic activity especially for the biceps.

The classification accuracy on 22 class hand activities is 75:39% by the same SVM classifier with the log moments in frequency domain (LMF) feature, modified LMF, time domain statistical (TDS) feature, spectral band powers (SBP), channel cross correlation and local binary patterns (LBP) set ensemble. The analysis depicts the technical challenges addressed by the dataset. The developed dataset can be used as a benchmark for various classification methods as well as for sEMG signal analysis corresponding to ADL and for the development of prosthetics and other wearable robotics.","classes":{"dataset":0.0078953905,"prompteng":0.0030500509}}
{"title":"Deep Injective Prior for Inverse Scattering","description":"In electromagnetic inverse scattering, we aim to reconstruct object permittivity from scattered waves. Deep learning is a promising alternative to traditional iterative solvers, but it has been used mostly in a supervised framework to regress the permittivity patterns from scattered fields or back-projections. While such methods are fast at test-time and achieve good results for specific data distributions, they are sensitive to the distribution drift of the scattered fields, common in practice. If the distribution of the scattered fields changes due to changes in frequency, the number of transmitters and receivers, or any other real-world factor, an end-to-end neural network must be re-trained or fine-tuned on a new dataset. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven framework for inverse scattering based on deep generative models. We model the target permittivities by a low-dimensional manifold which acts as a regularizer and learned from data. Unlike supervised methods which require both scattered fields and target signals, we only need the target permittivities for training; it can then be used with any experimental setup. We show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the traditional iterative methods especially for strong scatterers while having comparable reconstruction quality to state-of-the-art deep learning methods like U-Net.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03092v1","created":"2023-01-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Deep Injective Prior for Inverse Scattering In electromagnetic inverse scattering, we aim to reconstruct object permittivity from scattered waves.

With this proposal, we hope to achieve: a) a unified semantic representation for PE malware datasets that are available or will be published in the future; (b) applicability of symbolic, neural-symbolic, or otherwise explainable approaches in the PE Malware domain that may lead to improved interpretability of results which may now be characterized by the terms defined in the ontology; and (c)by joint publishing of semantically treated EMBER data, including fractional datasets, also improved reproducibility of experiments.","classes":{"dataset":0.9754897356,"prompteng":0.0030293653}}
{"title":"A Fine-Grained Vehicle Detection (FGVD) Dataset for Unconstrained Roads","description":"The previous fine-grained datasets mainly focus on classification and are often captured in a controlled setup, with the camera focusing on the objects. We introduce the first Fine-Grained Vehicle Detection (FGVD) dataset in the wild, captured from a moving camera mounted on a car.

While previous classification datasets also include makes for different kinds of cars, the FGVD dataset introduces new class labels for categorizing two-wheelers, autorickshaws, and trucks. The FGVD dataset is challenging as it has vehicles in complex traffic scenarios with intra-class and inter-class variations in types, scale, pose, occlusion, and lighting conditions. The current object detectors like yolov5 and faster RCNN perform poorly on our dataset due to a lack of hierarchical modeling.

Traditionally, comparing building shapes requires matching their known properties and shape metrics with each other. However, this requires obtaining a plethora of such properties to calculate similarity. In contrast, this study utilizes an autoencoder-based method to compute the shape information in a fixed-size vector form that can be compared and grouped with the help of distance metrics.

However, the learning-based models developed on closed datasets are susceptible to unknown anomalies in complex clinical environments. In particular, the high false positive rate of polyp detection remains a major challenge in clinical practice. In this work, we release the FPPD-13 dataset, which provides a taxonomy and real-world cases of typical false positives during computer-aided polyp detection in real-world colonoscopy. We further propose a post-hoc module EndoBoost, which can be plugged into generic polyp detection models to filter out false positive predictions. This is realized by generative learning of the polyp manifold with normalizing flows and rejecting false positives through density estimation. Compared to supervised classification, this anomaly detection paradigm achieves better data efficiency and robustness in open-world settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate a promising false positive suppression in both retrospective and prospective validation.

The central problem in data trading is to estimate the utility of a seller's dataset with respect to a given buyer's machine learning task, also known as data valuation. Typically, data valuation requires one or more participants to share their raw dataset with others, leading to potential risks of intellectual property (IP) violations. In this paper, we tackle the novel task of preemptively protecting the IP of datasets that need to be shared during data valuation. First, we identify and formalize two kinds of novel IP risks in visual datasets: data-item (image) IP and statistical (dataset) IP. Then, we propose a novel algorithm to convert the raw dataset into a sanitized version, that provides resistance to IP violations, while at the same time allowing accurate data valuation. The key idea is to limit the transfer of information from the raw dataset to the sanitized dataset, thereby protecting against potential intellectual property violations.

Our proposed method supports the construction of massively scalable, decentralized face recognition systems with a focus on both privacy and long-term usability.","classes":{"dataset":0.4007569551,"prompteng":0.0031670418}}
{"title":"Benchmarking person re-identification datasets and approaches for practical real-world implementations","description":"Recently, Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has received a lot of attention. Large datasets containing labeled images of various individuals have been released, allowing researchers to develop and test many successful approaches. However, when such Re-ID models are deployed in new cities or environments, the task of searching for people within a network of security cameras is likely to face an important domain shift, thus resulting in decreased performance. Indeed, while most public datasets were collected in a limited geographic area, images from a new city present different features (e.g., people's ethnicity and clothing style, weather, architecture, etc.). In addition, the whole frames of the video streams must be converted into cropped images of people using pedestrian detection models, which behave differently from the human annotators who created the dataset used for training. To better understand the extent of this issue, this paper introduces a complete methodology to evaluate Re-ID approaches and training datasets with respect to their suitability for unsupervised deployment for live operations. This method is used to benchmark four Re-ID approaches on three datasets, providing insight and guidelines that can help to design better Re-ID pipelines in the future.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09981v1","created":"2022-12-20","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Benchmarking person re-identification datasets and approaches for practical real-world implementations Recently, Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has received a lot of attention.

{"title":"Automatic Classification of Galaxy Morphology: a rotationally invariant supervised machine learning method based on the UML-dataset","description":"Classification of galaxy morphology is a challenging but meaningful task for the enormous amount of data produced by the next-generation telescope. By introducing the adaptive polar coordinate transformation, we develop a rotationally invariant supervised machine learning (SML) method that ensures consistent classifications when rotating galaxy images, which is always required to be satisfied physically but difficult to achieve algorithmically. The adaptive polar coordinate transformation, compared with the conventional method of data augmentation by including additional rotated images in the training set, is proved to be an effective and efficient method in improving the robustness of the SML methods. In the previous work, we generated a catalog of galaxies with well-classified morphologies via our developed unsupervised machine learning (UML) method.

{"title":"Optimus-CC: Efficient Large NLP Model Training with 3D Parallelism Aware Communication Compression","description":"In training of modern large natural language processing (NLP) models, it has become a common practice to split models using 3D parallelism to multiple GPUs. Such technique, however, suffers from a high overhead of inter-node communication. Compressing the communication is one way to mitigate the overhead by reducing the inter-node traffic volume; however, the existing compression techniques have critical limitations to be applied for NLP models with 3D parallelism in that 1) only the data parallelism traffic is targeted, and 2) the existing compression schemes already harm the model quality too much.   In this paper, we present Optimus-CC, a fast and scalable distributed training framework for large NLP models with aggressive communication compression. Optimus-CC differs from existing communication compression frameworks in the following ways: First, we compress pipeline parallel (inter-stage) traffic. In specific, we compress the inter-stage backpropagation and the embedding synchronization in addition to the existing data-parallel traffic compression methods. Second, we propose techniques to avoid the model quality drop that comes from the compression. We further provide mathematical and empirical analyses to show that our techniques can successfully suppress the compression error. Lastly, we analyze the pipeline and opt to selectively compress those traffic lying on the critical path. This further helps reduce the compression error. We demonstrate our solution on a GPU cluster, and achieve superior speedup from the baseline state-of-the-art solutions for distributed training without sacrificing the model quality.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09830v1","created":"2023-01-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Optimus-CC: Efficient Large NLP Model Training with 3D Parallelism Aware Communication Compression In training of modern large natural language processing (NLP) models, it has become a common practice to split models using 3D parallelism to multiple GPUs.

In this paper, we present Optimus-CC, a fast and scalable distributed training framework for large NLP models with aggressive communication compression. Optimus-CC differs from existing communication compression frameworks in the following ways: First, we compress pipeline parallel (inter-stage) traffic. In specific, we compress the inter-stage backpropagation and the embedding synchronization in addition to the existing data-parallel traffic compression methods. Second, we propose techniques to avoid the model quality drop that comes from the compression. We further provide mathematical and empirical analyses to show that our techniques can successfully suppress the compression error. Lastly, we analyze the pipeline and opt to selectively compress those traffic lying on the critical path. This further helps reduce the compression error. We demonstrate our solution on a GPU cluster, and achieve superior speedup from the baseline state-of-the-art solutions for distributed training without sacrificing the model quality.","classes":{"dataset":0.1183989346,"prompteng":0.0411627516}}

{"title":"Employing similarity to highlight differences: On the impact of anatomical assumptions in chest X-ray registration methods","description":"To facilitate both the detection and the interpretation of findings in chest X-rays, comparison with a previous image of the same patient is very valuable to radiologists. Today, the most common approach for deep learning methods to automatically inspect chest X-rays disregards the patient history and classifies only single images as normal or abnormal. Nevertheless, several methods for assisting in the task of comparison through image registration have been proposed in the past. However, as we illustrate, they tend to miss specific types of pathological changes like cardiomegaly and effusion. Due to assumptions on fixed anatomical structures or their measurements of registration quality, they produce unnaturally deformed warp fields impacting visualization of differences between moving and fixed images. We aim to overcome these limitations, through a new paradigm based on individual rib pair segmentation for anatomy penalized registration. Our method proves to be a natural way to limit the folding percentage of the warp field to 1/6 of the state of the art while increasing the overlap of ribs by more than 25%, implying difference images showing pathological changes overlooked by other methods. We develop an anatomically penalized convolutional multi-stage solution on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) data set, starting from less than 25 fully and 50 partly labeled training images, employing sequential instance memory segmentation with hole dropout, weak labeling, coarse-to-fine refinement and Gaussian mixture model histogram matching.

Concentrations of MTS were then set at the domain boundaries, and the domain was gradually infiltrated with MTS as time progressed. The concentration of MTS at the surface of the preform fibers was calculated using the adopted BSM.

The latent codes can then be bridged with the avatar vectors as pairs, by performing GAN inversion on the avatar images rendered from the engine using avatar vectors.

We also propose semantic augmentation to improve the diversity of synthesis. Finally, a light-weight avatar vector estimator is trained on the synthetic pairs to implement efficient auto-creation.

{"title":"Fast Inference in Denoising Diffusion Models via MMD Finetuning","description":"Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) have become a popular tool for generating high-quality samples from complex data distributions. These models are able to capture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate samples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying distribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the complexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is required to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present MMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is based on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the learned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the finetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by substantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or, equivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target fidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models in a wide range of applications. We evaluate our approach on unconditional image generation with extensive experiments across the CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet and LSUN-Church datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method is able to produce high-quality samples in a fraction of the time required by widely-used diffusion models, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for accelerated sampling.

The recruitment of trustworthy and high-quality workers is an important research issue for MCS. Previous studies assume that the qualities of workers are known in advance, or the platform knows the qualities of workers once it receives their collected data.

{"title":"Sparsity based morphological identification of heartbeats","description":"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most common primary tests to evaluate the health of the heart. Reliable automatic interpretation of ECG records is crucial to the goal of improving public health. It can enable a safe inexpensive monitoring. This work presents a new methodology for morphological identification of heartbeats, which is placed outside the usual machine learning framework. The proposal considers the sparsity of the representation of a heartbeat as a parameter for morphological identification. The approach involves greedy algorithms for selecting elements from redundant dictionaries, which should be previously learnt from examples of the classes to be identified. Using different metrics of sparsity, the dictionary rendering the smallest sparsity value, for the equivalent approximation quality of a new heartbeat, classifies the morphology of that beat. This study focuses on a procedure of learning the dictionaries for representing heartbeats and compares several metrics of sparsity for morphological identification on the basis of those metrics. The suitability of the method is illustrated by binary differentiation of Normal and Ventricular heartbeats in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data set.

{"title":"Application of Causal Inference Techniques to the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem","description":"A powerful technique for solving combinatorial optimization problems is to reduce the search space without compromising the solution quality by exploring intrinsic mathematical properties of the problems.

{"title":"Application of machine learning to gas flaring","description":"Currently in the petroleum industry, operators often flare the produced gas instead of commodifying it. The flaring magnitudes are large in some states, which constitute problems with energy waste and CO2 emissions. In North Dakota, operators are required to estimate and report the volume flared. The questions are, how good is the quality of this reporting, and what insights can be drawn from it? Apart from the company-reported statistics, which are available from the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), flared volumes can be estimated via satellite remote sensing, serving as an unbiased benchmark. Since interpretation of the Landsat 8 imagery is hindered by artifacts due to glow, the estimated volumes based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are used. Reverse geocoding is performed for comparing and contrasting the NDIC and VIIRS data at different levels, such as county and oilfield. With all the data gathered and preprocessed, Bayesian learning implemented by MCMC methods is performed to address three problems: county level model development, flaring time series analytics, and distribution estimation. First, there is heterogeneity among the different counties, in the associations between the NDIC and VIIRS volumes. In light of such, models are developed for each county by exploiting hierarchical models. Second, the flaring time series, albeit noisy, contains information regarding trends and patterns, which provide some insights into operator approaches.

The flaring magnitudes are large in some states, which constitute problems with energy waste and CO2 emissions. In North Dakota, operators are required to estimate and report the volume flared. The questions are, how good is the quality of this reporting, and what insights can be drawn from it? Apart from the company-reported statistics, which are available from the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), flared volumes can be estimated via satellite remote sensing, serving as an unbiased benchmark. Since interpretation of the Landsat 8 imagery is hindered by artifacts due to glow, the estimated volumes based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are used. Reverse geocoding is performed for comparing and contrasting the NDIC and VIIRS data at different levels, such as county and oilfield. With all the data gathered and preprocessed, Bayesian learning implemented by MCMC methods is performed to address three problems: county level model development, flaring time series analytics, and distribution estimation. First, there is heterogeneity among the different counties, in the associations between the NDIC and VIIRS volumes. In light of such, models are developed for each county by exploiting hierarchical models. Second, the flaring time series, albeit noisy, contains information regarding trends and patterns, which provide some insights into operator approaches. Gaussian processes are found to be effective in many different pattern recognition scenarios. Third, distributional insights are obtained through unsupervised learning.

{"title":"Predicting Drivers' Route Trajectories in Last-Mile Delivery Using A Pair-wise Attention-based Pointer Neural Network","description":"In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field.

It was shown that consistent application of the proposed augmentation methods in the implemented technology stack improves the quality of reservoir prediction by a factor of 1.56 relative to the original dataset.","classes":{"dataset":0.1611145437,"prompteng":0.0717222095}}

Methods: Koma was developed using the Julia programming language. Like other MRI simulators, it solves the Bloch equations with CPU and GPU parallelization. The inputs are the scanner parameters, the phantom, and the pulse sequence that is Pulseq-compatible. The raw data is stored in the ISMRMRD format. For the reconstruction, MRIReco.jl is used. A graphical user interface utilizing web technologies was also designed. Two types of experiments were performed: one to compare the quality of the results and the execution speed, and the second to compare its usability. Finally, the use of Koma in quantitative imaging was demonstrated by simulating Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) acquisitions.   Results: Koma was compared to two well-known open-source MRI simulators, JEMRIS and MRiLab.

{"title":"3D dose prediction for Gamma Knife radiosurgery using deep learning and data modification","description":"Purpose: To develop a machine learning-based, 3D dose prediction methodology for Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery. The methodology accounts for cases involving targets of any number, size, and shape. Methods: Data from 322 GK treatment plans was modified by isolating and cropping the contoured MRI and clinical dose distributions based on tumor location, then scaling the resulting tumor spaces to a standard size. An accompanying 3D tensor was created for each instance to account for tumor size. The modified dataset for 272 patients was used to train both a generative adversarial network (GAN-GK) and a 3D U-Net model (U-Net-GK). Unmodified data was used to train equivalent baseline models. All models were used to predict the dose distribution of 50 out-of-sample patients. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using gamma, with criteria of 4%/2mm, 3%/3mm, 3%/1mm and 1%/1mm. Prediction quality was assessed using coverage, selectivity, and conformity indices. Results: The predictions resulting from GAN-GK and U-Net-GK were similar to their clinical counterparts, with average gamma (4%/2mm) passing rates of 84.9 and 83.1, respectively. In contrast, the gamma passing rate of baseline models were significantly worse than their respective GK-specific models (p < 0.001) at all criterion levels. The quality of GK-specific predictions was also similar to that of clinical plans.

In data-driven modeling, machine learning methods such as linear regression, neural networks or decision-tree based methods are being applied. While these methods do not require domain knowledge, they are sensitive to data quality. Therefore, improving data quality in a dataset is beneficial for creating machine learning-based models. The improvement of data quality can be implemented through preprocessing methods. A selected type of preprocessing is feature engineering, which focuses on evaluating and improving the quality of certain features inside the dataset. Feature engineering methods include methods such as feature creation, feature expansion, or feature selection. In this work, a Python framework containing different feature engineering methods is presented. This framework contains different methods for feature creation, expansion and selection; in addition, methods for transforming or filtering data are implemented.

{"title":"Machine Learning-based Signal Quality Assessment for Cardiac Volume Monitoring in Electrical Impedance Tomography","description":"Owing to recent advances in thoracic electrical impedance tomography, a patient's hemodynamic function can be noninvasively and continuously estimated in real-time by surveilling a cardiac volume signal associated with stroke volume and cardiac output. In clinical applications, however, a cardiac volume signal is often of low quality, mainly because of the patient's deliberate movements or inevitable motions during clinical interventions. This study aims to develop a signal quality indexing method that assesses the influence of motion artifacts on transient cardiac volume signals. The assessment is performed on each cardiac cycle to take advantage of the periodicity and regularity in cardiac volume changes. Time intervals are identified using the synchronized electrocardiography system. We apply divergent machine-learning methods, which can be sorted into discriminative-model and manifold-learning approaches. The use of machine-learning could be suitable for our real-time monitoring application that requires fast inference and automation as well as high accuracy. In the clinical environment, the proposed method can be utilized to provide immediate warnings so that clinicians can minimize confusion regarding patients' conditions, reduce clinical resource utilization, and improve the confidence level of the monitoring system. Numerous experiments using actual EIT data validate the capability of cardiac volume signals degraded by motion artifacts to be accurately and automatically assessed in real-time by machine learning.

This paper presents a high quality dataset containing light curves from the Primary Mission and 1st Extended Mission full frame images and periodic signals detected via Box Least Squares (Kov\\'acs et al. 2002; Hartman 2012). The dataset was curated using a thorough manual review process then used to train a neural network called Astronet-Triage-v2.

Since 90% of our training data is from the Primary Mission, we also test our ability to generalize on held-out 1st Extended Mission data.

{"title":"IRT2: Inductive Linking and Ranking in Knowledge Graphs of Varying Scale","description":"We address the challenge of building domain-specific knowledge models for industrial use cases, where labelled data and taxonomic information is initially scarce. Our focus is on inductive link prediction models as a basis for practical tools that support knowledge engineers with exploring text collections and discovering and linking new (so-called open-world) entities to the knowledge graph. We argue that - though neural approaches to text mining have yielded impressive results in the past years - current benchmarks do not reflect the typical challenges encountered in the industrial wild properly. Therefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive reasoning with text) that (1) covers knowledge graphs of varying sizes (including very small ones), (2) comes with incidental, low-quality text mentions, and (3) includes not only triple completion but also ranking, which is relevant for supporting experts with discovery tasks.   We investigate two neural models for inductive link prediction, one based on end-to-end learning and one that learns from the knowledge graph and text data in separate steps. These models compete with a strong bag-of-words baseline. The results show a significant advance in performance for the neural approaches as soon as the available graph data decreases for linking. For ranking, the results are promising, and the neural approaches outperform the sparse retriever by a wide margin.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00716v1","created":"2023-01-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"IRT2: Inductive Linking and Ranking in Knowledge Graphs of Varying Scale We address the challenge of building domain-specific knowledge models for industrial use cases, where labelled data and taxonomic information is initially scarce.

{"title":"In-situ monitoring additive manufacturing process with AI edge computing","description":"In-situ monitoring system can be used to monitor the quality of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. In the case of digital image correlation (DIC) based in-situ monitoring systems, high-speed cameras were used to capture images of high resolutions. This paper proposed a novel in-situ monitoring system to accelerate the process of digital images using artificial intelligence (AI) edge computing board. It built a visual transformer based video super resolution (ViTSR) network to reconstruct high resolution (HR) videos frames. Fully convolutional network (FCN) was used to simultaneously extract the geometric characteristics of molten pool and plasma arc during the AM processes. Compared with 6 state-of-the-art super resolution methods, ViTSR ranks first in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The PSNR of ViTSR for 4x super resolution reached 38.16 dB on test data with input size of 75 pixels x 75 pixels. Inference time of ViTSR and FCN was optimized to 50.97 ms and 67.86 ms on AI edge board after operator fusion and model pruning. The total inference time of the proposed system was 118.83 ms, which meets the requirement of real-time quality monitoring with low cost in-situ monitoring equipment during AM processes.

I have tried with Colab and the data in google drive, but drive gets confused with multiple files so it's really annoying.\n\nAny suggestions on how to do this in the cloud? I also have some experience with GCP and Azure, but AWS is the provider I have the most experience with. Can I do this without suffering too much when handling data around or should I just buy a 4090 and train stuff locally?","classes":{"dataset":0.2992943525,"prompteng":0.0718791187}}

And then those models were deployed as Models as a Service: `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, `davinci`, etc. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone knows what the distillation process looked / looks like? Or if anyone knows anything about the debiasing process at OpenAI for the GPT-3 variants?","classes":{"dataset":0.2115779817,"prompteng":0.0634531304}}

However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space.

However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments.

The next logical step: deriving actual calibration functions!\n\nFor this part I created a small tutorial that shows the already existing functions to compute the velocity of dust impacts, based on some electric signals. *Why is the velocity so important?* Well, based on the impact speed and direction of the instrument at the \"moment\" of impact, one can derive astro-dynamical insights.\n\nAnd later ... when we take a look at the science part ... you will see that ... well I don't want to spoil ... you can create amazing science results with these \"simple\" computations!\n\nAnyway, further I compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RSME) to obtain some performance result of the calibration functions. *Why?* Well next week we will use a **Tensorflow / Keras** based approach to create a **Machine Learning based calibration function**. The MAEs and RSME are the \"benchmark\" values we need to \"beat\".\n\nStay tuned,\n\nThomas\n\nVideo: [https://youtu.be/RkVx-7fcVRY](https://youtu.be/RkVx-7fcVRY)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/%5BProject%5D-Cassini-CDA/01-Calibration/02\\_prior\\_calibration.ipynb](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/%5BProject%5D-Cassini-CDA/01-Calibration/02_prior_calibration.ipynb)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/120zfin/nasas_cassini_cosmic_dust_analyzer_a_proper/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":2},"text":"NASA's Cassini - Cosmic Dust Analyzer: A proper calibration!

{"title":"SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis","description":"For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings, such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or allow fine-grained error analysis are critical. Many recent methods for interpretability/explainability and fine-grained error analysis use concepts, which are meta-labels that are semantically meaningful to humans. However, there are only a few datasets that include concept-level meta-labels and most of these meta-labels are relevant for natural images that do not require domain expertise. Densely annotated datasets in medicine focused on meta-labels that are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin lesions. Examples include \"plaque\", \"scale\", and \"erosion\". The same concepts were also used to label 656 skin disease images from the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset, providing an additional external dataset with diverse skin tone representations. We review the potential applications for the SkinCon dataset, such as probing models, concept-based explanations, and concept bottlenecks. Furthermore, we use SkinCon to demonstrate two of these use cases: debugging mistakes of an existing dermatology AI model with concepts and developing interpretable models with post-hoc concept bottleneck models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00785v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings, such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or allow fine-grained error analysis are critical.

{"title":"Revisiting Query Performance in GPU Database Systems","description":"GPUs offer massive compute parallelism and high-bandwidth memory accesses. GPU database systems seek to exploit those capabilities to accelerate data analytics. Although modern GPUs have more resources (e.g., higher DRAM bandwidth) than ever before, judicious choices for query processing that avoid wasteful resource allocations are still advantageous. Database systems can save GPU runtime costs through just-enough resource allocation or improve query throughput with concurrent query processing by leveraging new GPU capabilities, such as Multi-Instance GPU (MIG).   In this paper we do a cross-stack performance and resource utilization analysis of five GPU database systems. We study both database-level and micro-architectural aspects, and offer recommendations to database developers. We also demonstrate how to use and extend the traditional roofline model to identify GPU resource bottlenecks. This enables users to conduct what-if analysis to forecast performance impact for different resource allocation or the degree of concurrency. Our methodology addresses a key user pain point in selecting optimal configurations by removing the need to do exhaustive testing for a multitude of resource configurations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00734v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Revisiting Query Performance in GPU Database Systems GPUs offer massive compute parallelism and high-bandwidth memory accesses.

{"title":"Universal Soldier: Using Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Detecting Backdoor Attacks","description":"Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped with a pre-designed pattern called \"trigger\". Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger. We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB) and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on 345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00747v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Universal Soldier: Using Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Detecting Backdoor Attacks Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine learning tasks.

{"title":"ImageNomer: developing an fMRI and omics visualization tool to detect racial bias in functional connectivity","description":"It can be difficult to identify trends and perform quality control in large, high-dimensional fMRI or omics datasets. To remedy this, we develop ImageNomer, a data visualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level and cohort-level features. The tool allows visualization of phenotype correlation with functional connectivity (FC), partial connectivity (PC), dictionary components (PCA and our own method), and genomic data (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). In addition, it allows visualization of weights from arbitrary ML models. ImageNomer is built with a Python backend and a Vue frontend. We validate ImageNomer using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset, which contains multitask fMRI and SNP data of healthy adolescents. Using correlation, greedy selection, or model weights, we find that a set of 10 FC features can explain 15% of variation in age, compared to 35% for the full 34,716 feature model. The four most significant FCs are either between bilateral default mode network (DMN) regions or spatially proximal subcortical areas. Additionally, we show that whereas both FC (fMRI) and SNPs (genomic) features can account for 10-15% of intelligence variation, this predictive ability disappears when controlling for race. We find that FC features can be used to predict race with 85% accuracy, compared to 78% accuracy for sex prediction.

{"title":"Ariadne Codegen: code generator for Python GraphQL clients","description":"Hey everyone!\n\nRecently we've released [Ariadne Codegen](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen), a new tool for Python which generates GraphQL clients from `*.graphql` files with schema and queries. This project evolved from the utility tool that was created at work to speed up the process of writing services integrating with and extending the GraphQL API of [Saleor](https://graphql.com/saleor/saleor), our company's open source e-commerce package.\n\nTL;DR for the problem solved is that writing GraphQL client by hand is mostly writing a lot of boilerplate code and translating the GraphQL types to Python dataclasses or Pydantic's models. And every new query is basically previous query copied over with some bits changed. This process is great for automation.\n\nOur Codegen is fast to get started with. You configure it by adding dedicated `[ariadne-codegen]` section to your `pyproject.toml` file, which contains settings for codegen telling it where to find the GraphQL schema and operations. You then run the ariadne-codegen command which makes the Codegen parse those files and generate a Python package implementing the GraphQL client providing those operations as fully typed methods. GraphQL types are represented as Pydantic models and Enums are represented as Python enums.\n\nFor example, this GraphQL query:\n\n    mutation UserCreate($name: String!, $email: String!, $password: String!) {\n      userCreate(input: { name: $name, email: $email, password: $password }) {\n        token\n        user {\n          id\n        }\n        errors {\n          location\n          type\n          message\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nBecomes this method on generated client:\n\n    class Client(BaseClient):\n        def user_create(self, name: str, email: str, password: str) -&gt; UserCreate:\n            # Bunch of boilerplate code building query and variables dict,\n            # then sending it to the GraphQL client and handling the response\n            return UserCreate.parse_obj(data)\n\nYou can then either release generated package as a library for others to use, or keep it as a part of the project you are working at\n\nMultiple customization options are also provided, including option switch between async and sync client, inject custom Python code into generated classes or swap default HTTP client with custom one.\n\n**GitHub repository:** [mirumee/ariadne-codegen](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen)\n\nThere's also full [release announcement on Ariadne blog](https://ariadnegraphql.org/blog/2023/02/02/ariadne-codegen) that tells the whole story\n\nThank you for reading all of this.

In this paper, we investigate the connection between the durability of FL backdoors and the relationships between benign images and poisoned images (i.e., the images whose labels are flipped to the target label during local training). Specifically, benign images with the original and the target labels of the poisoned images are found to have key effects on backdoor durability. Consequently, we propose a novel attack, Chameleon, which utilizes contrastive learning to further amplify such effects towards a more durable backdoor.

{"title":"Improving Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks with Deeply Quantized Neural Networks","description":"Reducing the memory footprint of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is essential to enable their deployment into resource-constrained tiny devices. However, a disadvantage of DNN models is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as they can be fooled by adding slight perturbations to the inputs. Therefore, the challenge is how to create accurate, robust, and tiny DNN models deployable on resource-constrained embedded devices. This paper reports the results of devising a tiny DNN model, robust to adversarial black and white box attacks, trained with an automatic quantizationaware training framework, i.e. QKeras, with deep quantization loss accounted in the learning loop, thereby making the designed DNNs more accurate for deployment on tiny devices. We investigated how QKeras and an adversarial robustness technique, Jacobian Regularization (JR), can provide a co-optimization strategy by exploiting the DNN topology and the per layer JR approach to produce robust yet tiny deeply quantized DNN models. As a result, a new DNN model implementing this cooptimization strategy was conceived, developed and tested on three datasets containing both images and audio inputs, as well as compared its performance with existing benchmarks against various white-box and black-box attacks.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provides an opportunity to develop an interactive, communicative, and robust human-robot collaboration approach. This paper explores the impact of ChatGPT on trust in a human-robot collaboration assembly task. This study designs a robot control system called RoboGPT using ChatGPT to control a 7-degree-of-freedom robot arm to help human operators fetch, and place tools, while human operators can communicate with and control the robot arm using natural language. A human-subject experiment showed that incorporating ChatGPT in robots significantly increased trust in human-robot collaboration, which can be attributed to the robot's ability to communicate more effectively with humans. Furthermore, ChatGPT ability to understand the nuances of human language and respond appropriately helps to build a more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of human-robot collaboration systems.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12529v1","created":"2023-04-25","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"Improved Trust in Human-Robot Collaboration with ChatGPT Human robot collaboration is becoming increasingly important as robots become more involved in various aspects of human life in the era of Artificial Intelligence.

{"title":"Escaping the sentence-level paradigm in machine translation","description":"It is well-known that document context is vital for resolving a range of translation ambiguities, and in fact the document setting is the most natural setting for nearly all translation. It is therefore unfortunate that machine translation -- both research and production -- largely remains stuck in a decades-old sentence-level translation paradigm. It is also an increasingly glaring problem in light of competitive pressure from large language models, which are natively document-based. Much work in document-context machine translation exists, but for various reasons has been unable to catch hold. This paper suggests a path out of this rut by addressing three impediments at once: what architectures should we use? where do we get document-level information for training them? and how do we know whether they are any good? In contrast to work on specialized architectures, we show that the standard Transformer architecture is sufficient, provided it has enough capacity. Next, we address the training data issue by taking document samples from back-translated data only, where the data is not only more readily available, but is also of higher quality compared to parallel document data, which may contain machine translation output. Finally, we propose generative variants of existing contrastive metrics that are better able to discriminate among document systems. Results in four large-data language pairs (DE$\\rightarrow$EN, EN$\\rightarrow$DE, EN$\\rightarrow$FR, and EN$\\rightarrow$RU) establish the success of these three pieces together in improving document-level performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12959v1","created":"2023-04-25","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Escaping the sentence-level paradigm in machine translation It is well-known that document context is vital for resolving a range of translation ambiguities, and in fact the document setting is the most natural setting for nearly all translation.

{"title":"Latent diffusion models for generative precipitation nowcasting with accurate uncertainty quantification","description":"Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image generation, producing higher-quality and more diverse samples than generative adversarial networks (GANs). We introduce a latent diffusion model (LDM) for precipitation nowcasting - short-term forecasting based on the latest observational data. The LDM is more stable and requires less computation to train than GANs, albeit with more computationally expensive generation. We benchmark it against the GAN-based Deep Generative Models of Rainfall (DGMR) and a statistical model, PySTEPS. The LDM produces more accurate precipitation predictions, while the comparisons are more mixed when predicting whether the precipitation exceeds predefined thresholds. The clearest advantage of the LDM is that it generates more diverse predictions than DGMR or PySTEPS. Rank distribution tests indicate that the distribution of samples from the LDM accurately reflects the uncertainty of the predictions. Thus, LDMs are promising for any applications where uncertainty quantification is important, such as weather and climate.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12891v1","created":"2023-04-25","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Latent diffusion models for generative precipitation nowcasting with accurate uncertainty quantification Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image generation, producing higher-quality and more diverse samples than generative adversarial networks (GANs).

{"title":"Hybrid Neural Rendering for Large-Scale Scenes with Motion Blur","description":"Rendering novel view images is highly desirable for many applications. Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to render high-fidelity and view-consistent novel views of large-scale scenes from in-the-wild images with inevitable artifacts (e.g., motion blur). To this end, we develop a hybrid neural rendering model that makes image-based representation and neural 3D representation join forces to render high-quality, view-consistent images. Besides, images captured in the wild inevitably contain artifacts, such as motion blur, which deteriorates the quality of rendered images. Accordingly, we propose strategies to simulate blur effects on the rendered images to mitigate the negative influence of blurriness images and reduce their importance during training based on precomputed quality-aware weights. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate our model surpasses state-of-the-art point-based methods for novel view synthesis.

{"title":"Generalist Vision Foundation Models for Medical Imaging: A Case Study of Segment Anything Model on Zero-Shot Medical Segmentation","description":"We examine the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) on medical images, and report both quantitative and qualitative zero-shot segmentation results on nine medical image segmentation benchmarks, covering various imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT), as well as different applications including dermatology, ophthalmology, and radiology. Our experiments reveal that while SAM demonstrates stunning segmentation performance on images from the general domain, for those out-of-distribution images, e.g., medical images, its zero-shot segmentation performance is still limited. Furthermore, SAM demonstrated varying zero-shot segmentation performance across different unseen medical domains. For example, it had a 0.8704 mean Dice score on segmenting under-bruch's membrane layer of retinal OCT, whereas the segmentation accuracy drops to 0.0688 when segmenting retinal pigment epithelium. For certain structured targets, e.g., blood vessels, the zero-shot segmentation of SAM completely failed, whereas a simple fine-tuning of it with small amount of data could lead to remarkable improvements of the segmentation quality. Our study indicates the versatility of generalist vision foundation models on solving specific tasks in medical imaging, and their great potential to achieve desired performance through fine-turning and eventually tackle the challenges of accessing large diverse medical datasets and the complexity of medical domains.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12637v1","created":"2023-04-25","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Generalist Vision Foundation Models for Medical Imaging: A Case Study of Segment Anything Model on Zero-Shot Medical Segmentation We examine the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) on medical images, and report both quantitative and qualitative zero-shot segmentation results on nine medical image segmentation benchmarks, covering various imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT), as well as different applications including dermatology, ophthalmology, and radiology.

{"title":"Learning the Unlearnable: Adversarial Augmentations Suppress Unlearnable Example Attacks","description":"Unlearnable example attacks are data poisoning techniques that can be used to safeguard public data against unauthorized use for training deep learning models. These methods add stealthy perturbations to the original image, thereby making it difficult for deep learning models to learn from these training data effectively. Current research suggests that adversarial training can, to a certain degree, mitigate the impact of unlearnable example attacks, while common data augmentation methods are not effective against such poisons. Adversarial training, however, demands considerable computational resources and can result in non-trivial accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce the UEraser method, which outperforms current defenses against different types of state-of-the-art unlearnable example attacks through a combination of effective data augmentation policies and loss-maximizing adversarial augmentations. In stark contrast to the current SOTA adversarial training methods, UEraser uses adversarial augmentations, which extends beyond the confines of $ \\ell_p $ perturbation budget assumed by current unlearning attacks and defenses. It also helps to improve the model's generalization ability, thus protecting against accuracy loss. UEraser wipes out the unlearning effect with error-maximizing data augmentations, thus restoring trained model accuracies. Interestingly, UEraser-Lite, a fast variant without adversarial augmentations, is also highly effective in preserving clean accuracies.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three well-known microscopy imaging datasets, and show that we can drastically reduce the amount of training data while retaining the quality of the denoising, thus alleviating the burden of acquiring paired data and enabling few-shot learning.

{"title":"DQSOps: Data Quality Scoring Operations Framework for Data-Driven Applications","description":"Data quality assessment has become a prominent component in the successful execution of complex data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) software systems. In practice, real-world applications generate huge volumes of data at speeds. These data streams require analysis and preprocessing before being permanently stored or used in a learning task. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to the systematic management and construction of high-quality datasets. Nevertheless, managing voluminous and high-velocity data streams is usually performed manually (i.e. offline), making it an impractical strategy in production environments. To address this challenge, DataOps has emerged to achieve life-cycle automation of data processes using DevOps principles. However, determining the data quality based on a fitness scale constitutes a complex task within the framework of DataOps. This paper presents a novel Data Quality Scoring Operations (DQSOps) framework that yields a quality score for production data in DataOps workflows.

In practice, real-world applications generate huge volumes of data at speeds. These data streams require analysis and preprocessing before being permanently stored or used in a learning task. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to the systematic management and construction of high-quality datasets. Nevertheless, managing voluminous and high-velocity data streams is usually performed manually (i.e. offline), making it an impractical strategy in production environments. To address this challenge, DataOps has emerged to achieve life-cycle automation of data processes using DevOps principles. However, determining the data quality based on a fitness scale constitutes a complex task within the framework of DataOps. This paper presents a novel Data Quality Scoring Operations (DQSOps) framework that yields a quality score for production data in DataOps workflows. The framework incorporates two scoring approaches, an ML prediction-based approach that predicts the data quality score and a standard-based approach that periodically produces the ground-truth scores based on assessing several data quality dimensions. We deploy the DQSOps framework in a real-world industrial use case.

By integrating state-of-the-art language models with advanced indexing and retrieval techniques, Recombinant AI represents a promising new direction in the pursuit of dynamic and versatile AGI systems.It\u2019s important for me to note that this methodology is not meant to supplant fine-tuning of an LLM. In fact, I believe this framework not only augments current fine-tuning strategies, but is itself strengthened by the utilization of fine-tuned external LLMs. However, I do believe that this presents the potential for a more flexible, dynamic, and accessible approach to model customization and improvement by an order of magnitude.\n\nMy approach to this involves 3 main components.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecombinant AI builds upon existing systems, but aims to revolutionize the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems by harnessing the power of pre-trained language models and lower dimensional indexing techniques. With the advent of increasingly sophisticated language models like GPT-4, the potential to create dynamic and modular AGI environments has never been more promising. In this section, we provide an overview of the key ideas behind Recombinant AI, illustrating its unique features, advantages, and potential applications.\n\nThe primary goal of Recombinant AI is to create distinct AI modules, each with its own knowledge base, conversational history, and personality guidelines. These modules can be seen as AGI \"game cartridges\" that can be loaded and interacted with on-demand, allowing users to engage with highly customizable AI applications that cater to specific needs and preferences.\n\nTo achieve this, Recombinant AI relies on two main components: pre-trained language models and efficient lower dimensional indexing techniques, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW). By combining these components, we can create highly scalable and adaptable AI modules that learn and evolve through user interactions.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An illustration demonstrating the interaction between pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing, and AI modules in the Recombinant AI framework.\\]\n\nIn the following sections, we delve deeper into the methodology, implementation details, and potential applications of Recombinant AI, exploring the unique challenges and opportunities it presents. We also discuss how the framework can adapt in real-time, allowing AI modules to learn from user inputs and improve their performance over time.\n\nThrough its innovative approach to AGI development, Recombinant AI has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from interactive storytelling and customer support to personalized AI assistants and AI-driven gaming. By offering dynamic, modular, and scalable solutions, Recombinant AI paves the way for a new era of interactive and versatile AI applications.\n\n1. Methodology and Implementation\n\nIn this section, we delve into the methodology and implementation details of Recombinant AI, providing an in-depth explanation of the key components, processes, and techniques involved in creating dynamic and modular AGI environments. We will discuss the role of pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing techniques, and prompt chaining strategies, as well as provide code examples and tables to illustrate the practical application of the framework.\n\n2.1 Pre-trained Language Models\n\nRecombinant AI leverages the power of pre-trained language models like GPT-4 to generate context-aware embeddings and responses. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data, making them capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on user inputs.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A table comparing different pre-trained language models, such as GPT-4, BERT, and RoBERTa, highlighting their key features, performance metrics, and suitability for various applications.\\]\n\n2.2 Lower Dimensional Indexing Techniques\n\nEfficient lower dimensional indexing techniques, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Graphs, Sparse Priming, and Clustering, play a crucial role in Recombinant AI. These techniques enable the framework to efficiently store, retrieve, and update AI module knowledge bases, conversational histories, and personality guidelines.\n\nHNSW is a graph-based indexing technique that allows for fast and accurate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces. It is particularly well-suited for Recombinant AI due to its scalability and adaptability.\n\nAdd definitions\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A diagram illustrating the structure and search process of an HNSW index, showing the hierarchical organization of nodes and the process of traversing the graph to find the nearest neighbors.\\]\n\n2.3 Prompt Chaining Strategies\n\nPrompt engineering and chaining enables the framework to systematically and consistently process simple input prompts into complex, reasoned outputs. The process involves crafting a programmatic data flow through inputs, catalyst indices or code, into desired outcomes that guide the language model through a specific line of reasoning or inquiry, resulting in a coherent and context-aware response.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An example of a prompt chain for a Dungeon Master AI module, illustrating the process of guiding the language model through a series of prompts to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.\n\n* Backend system prompt from the initial user message spins up the Dungeon Master RAI.\n* Base index of the user\u2019s conversational history, as well as the appropriate system role index are analyzed by the LLM\u2026.\n\n2.4 Code Examples and Implementation Details\n\nTo better illustrate the practical application of Recombinant AI, we provide code examples that demonstrate the process of creating and interacting with AI modules.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet showing the implementation of an HNSW index, embedding generation using GPT-4, and the process of querying the index based on user input.\\]\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet demonstrating the implementation of prompt chaining strategies to generate contextually relevant responses from the language model based on user input and module context.\\]\n\nBy combining these components and techniques, Recombinant AI creates a dynamic, modular, and scalable framework for AGI development, enabling the creation of highly customizable AI applications that adapt and learn through user interactions. In the next section, we explore the potential applications and use cases of Recombinant AI, as well as discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/123slpu/creating_dynamically_contextualized_modular_agi/","created":"2023-03-27","tags":["reddit","ml","machinelearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":0},"text":"Creating Dynamically Contextualized Modular AGI Environments in Lower-Dimensional Space [P], [R] **This white paper is still being edited.

In fact, I believe this framework not only augments current fine-tuning strategies, but is itself strengthened by the utilization of fine-tuned external LLMs. However, I do believe that this presents the potential for a more flexible, dynamic, and accessible approach to model customization and improvement by an order of magnitude.\n\nMy approach to this involves 3 main components.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecombinant AI builds upon existing systems, but aims to revolutionize the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems by harnessing the power of pre-trained language models and lower dimensional indexing techniques. With the advent of increasingly sophisticated language models like GPT-4, the potential to create dynamic and modular AGI environments has never been more promising. In this section, we provide an overview of the key ideas behind Recombinant AI, illustrating its unique features, advantages, and potential applications.\n\nThe primary goal of Recombinant AI is to create distinct AI modules, each with its own knowledge base, conversational history, and personality guidelines. These modules can be seen as AGI \"game cartridges\" that can be loaded and interacted with on-demand, allowing users to engage with highly customizable AI applications that cater to specific needs and preferences.\n\nTo achieve this, Recombinant AI relies on two main components: pre-trained language models and efficient lower dimensional indexing techniques, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW). By combining these components, we can create highly scalable and adaptable AI modules that learn and evolve through user interactions.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An illustration demonstrating the interaction between pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing, and AI modules in the Recombinant AI framework.\\]\n\nIn the following sections, we delve deeper into the methodology, implementation details, and potential applications of Recombinant AI, exploring the unique challenges and opportunities it presents. We also discuss how the framework can adapt in real-time, allowing AI modules to learn from user inputs and improve their performance over time.\n\nThrough its innovative approach to AGI development, Recombinant AI has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from interactive storytelling and customer support to personalized AI assistants and AI-driven gaming. By offering dynamic, modular, and scalable solutions, Recombinant AI paves the way for a new era of interactive and versatile AI applications.\n\n1. Methodology and Implementation\n\nIn this section, we delve into the methodology and implementation details of Recombinant AI, providing an in-depth explanation of the key components, processes, and techniques involved in creating dynamic and modular AGI environments. We will discuss the role of pre-trained language models, lower dimensional indexing techniques, and prompt chaining strategies, as well as provide code examples and tables to illustrate the practical application of the framework.\n\n2.1 Pre-trained Language Models\n\nRecombinant AI leverages the power of pre-trained language models like GPT-4 to generate context-aware embeddings and responses. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data, making them capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on user inputs.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A table comparing different pre-trained language models, such as GPT-4, BERT, and RoBERTa, highlighting their key features, performance metrics, and suitability for various applications.\\]\n\n2.2 Lower Dimensional Indexing Techniques\n\nEfficient lower dimensional indexing techniques, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Graphs, Sparse Priming, and Clustering, play a crucial role in Recombinant AI. These techniques enable the framework to efficiently store, retrieve, and update AI module knowledge bases, conversational histories, and personality guidelines.\n\nHNSW is a graph-based indexing technique that allows for fast and accurate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces. It is particularly well-suited for Recombinant AI due to its scalability and adaptability.\n\nAdd definitions\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A diagram illustrating the structure and search process of an HNSW index, showing the hierarchical organization of nodes and the process of traversing the graph to find the nearest neighbors.\\]\n\n2.3 Prompt Chaining Strategies\n\nPrompt engineering and chaining enables the framework to systematically and consistently process simple input prompts into complex, reasoned outputs. The process involves crafting a programmatic data flow through inputs, catalyst indices or code, into desired outcomes that guide the language model through a specific line of reasoning or inquiry, resulting in a coherent and context-aware response.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: An example of a prompt chain for a Dungeon Master AI module, illustrating the process of guiding the language model through a series of prompts to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.\n\n* Backend system prompt from the initial user message spins up the Dungeon Master RAI.\n* Base index of the user\u2019s conversational history, as well as the appropriate system role index are analyzed by the LLM\u2026.\n\n2.4 Code Examples and Implementation Details\n\nTo better illustrate the practical application of Recombinant AI, we provide code examples that demonstrate the process of creating and interacting with AI modules.\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet showing the implementation of an HNSW index, embedding generation using GPT-4, and the process of querying the index based on user input.\\]\n\n\\[CONTENT HERE: A code snippet demonstrating the implementation of prompt chaining strategies to generate contextually relevant responses from the language model based on user input and module context.\\]\n\nBy combining these components and techniques, Recombinant AI creates a dynamic, modular, and scalable framework for AGI development, enabling the creation of highly customizable AI applications that adapt and learn through user interactions. In the next section, we explore the potential applications and use cases of Recombinant AI, as well as discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.","classes":{"dataset":0.3104086816,"prompteng":0.1527345181}}

{"title":"LongForm: Optimizing Instruction Tuning for Long Text Generation with Corpus Extraction","description":"Instruction tuning enables language models to generalize more effectively and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data can be costly and challenging. Prior works employ methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, or generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm dataset, which is created by leveraging English corpus examples with augmented instructions. We select a diverse set of human-written documents from existing corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia and generate instructions for the given documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset and one suitable for long text generation. We finetune T5, OPT, and LLaMA models on our dataset and show that even smaller LongForm models have good generalization capabilities for text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on various tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large margin. Finally, our models can effectively follow and answer multilingual instructions; we demonstrate this for news generation.

{"title":"VALOR: Vision-Audio-Language Omni-Perception Pretraining Model and Dataset","description":"In this paper, we propose a Vision-Audio-Language Omni-peRception pretraining model (VALOR) for multi-modal understanding and generation. Different from widely-studied vision-language pretraining models, VALOR jointly models relationships of vision, audio and language in an end-to-end manner. It contains three separate encoders for single modality representations, and a decoder for multimodal conditional text generation. We design two pretext tasks to pretrain VALOR model, including Multimodal Grouping Alignment (MGA) and Multimodal Grouping Captioning (MGC). MGA projects vision, language and audio to the same common space, building vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language alignment simultaneously. MGC learns how to generate text tokens in conditions of vision, audio or their both. To promote vision-audio-language pretraining research, we construct a large-scale high-quality tri-modality dataset named VALOR-1M, which contains 1M audiable videos with human annotated audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments show that VALOR can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various downstream tasks (e.g., retrieval, captioning and question answering), with different input modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language).

For a cobot to act autonomously and as an assistant, it must understand human actions during assembly.

For this purpose, we present the ATTACH dataset, which contains 51.6 hours of assembly with 95.2k annotated fine-grained actions monitored by three cameras, which represent potential viewpoints of a cobot. Since in an assembly context workers tend to perform different actions simultaneously with their two hands, we annotated the performed actions for each hand separately. Therefore, in the ATTACH dataset, more than 68% of annotations overlap with other annotations, which is many times more than in related datasets, typically featuring more simplistic assembly tasks.

In this paper, we propose the first certified defense against multi-frame attacks for RNNs called RNN-Guard. To address the above challenge, we adopt the perturb-all-frame strategy to construct perturbation spaces consistent with those in multi-frame attacks. However, the perturb-all-frame strategy causes a precision issue in linear relaxations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel abstract domain called InterZono and design tighter relaxations.

Thus, characterization of changes to B0, e.g. induced by patient movement, is important for MR applications that are prone to B0 inhomogeneities. We propose a deep learning based method to predict such changes within the brain from the change of the head position to facilitate retrospective or even real-time correction. A 3D U-net was trained on in vivo brain 7T MRI data. The input consisted of B0 maps and anatomical images at an initial position, and anatomical images at a different head position (obtained by applying a rigid-body transformation on the initial anatomical image). The output consisted of B0 maps at the new head positions. We further fine-tuned the network weights to each subject by measuring a limited number of head positions of the given subject, and trained the U-net with these data. Our approach was compared to established dynamic B0 field mapping via interleaved navigators, which suffer from limited spatial resolution and the need for undesirable sequence modifications. Qualitative and quantitative comparison showed similar performance between an interleaved navigator-equivalent method and proposed method. We therefore conclude that it is feasible to predict B0 maps from rigid subject movement and, when combined with external tracking hardware, this information could be used to improve the quality of magnetic resonance acquisitions without the use of navigators.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08307v1","created":"2023-04-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Predicting dynamic, motion-related changes in B0 field in the brain at a 7 T MRI using a subject-specific fine-tuned U-net Subject movement during the magnetic resonance examination is inevitable and causes not only image artefacts but also deteriorates the homogeneity of the main magnetic field (B0), which is a prerequisite for high quality data. Thus, characterization of changes to B0, e.g. induced by patient movement, is important for MR applications that are prone to B0 inhomogeneities.

{"title":"Dumpy: A Compact and Adaptive Index for Large Data Series Collections","description":"Data series indexes are necessary for managing and analyzing the increasing amounts of data series collections that are nowadays available. These indexes support both exact and approximate similarity search, with approximate search providing high-quality results within milliseconds, which makes it very attractive for certain modern applications. Reducing the pre-processing (i.e., index building) time and improving the accuracy of search results are two major challenges. DSTree and the iSAX index family are state-of-the-art solutions for this problem. However, DSTree suffers from long index building times, while iSAX suffers from low search accuracy. In this paper, we identify two problems of the iSAX index family that adversely affect the overall performance. First, we observe the presence of a proximity-compactness trade-off related to the index structure design (i.e., the node fanout degree), significantly limiting the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting index. Second, a skewed data distribution will negatively affect the performance of iSAX. To overcome these problems, we propose Dumpy, an index that employs a novel multi-ary data structure with an adaptive node splitting algorithm and an efficient building workflow. Furthermore, we devise Dumpy-Fuzzy as a variant of Dumpy which further improves search accuracy by proper duplication of series. Experiments with a variety of large, real datasets demonstrate that the Dumpy solutions achieve considerably better efficiency, scalability and search accuracy than its competitors. This paper was published in SIGMOD'23.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08264v1","created":"2023-04-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Dumpy: A Compact and Adaptive Index for Large Data Series Collections Data series indexes are necessary for managing and analyzing the increasing amounts of data series collections that are nowadays available.

{"title":"Fast Random Approximation of Multi-channel Room Impulse Response","description":"Modern neural-network-based speech processing systems are typically required to be robust against reverberation, and the training of such systems thus needs a large amount of reverberant data. During the training of the systems, on-the-fly simulation pipeline is nowadays preferred as it allows the model to train on infinite number of data samples without pre-generating and saving them on harddisk. An RIR simulation method thus needs to not only generate more realistic artificial room impulse response (RIR) filters, but also generate them in a fast way to accelerate the training process. Existing RIR simulation tools have proven effective in a wide range of speech processing tasks and neural network architectures, but their usage in on-the-fly simulation pipeline remains questionable due to their computational complexity or the quality of the generated RIR filters. In this paper, we propose FRAM-RIR, a fast random approximation method of the widely-used image-source method (ISM), to efficiently generate realistic multi-channel RIR filters. FRAM-RIR bypasses the explicit calculation of sound propagation paths in ISM-based algorithms by randomly sampling the location and number of reflections of each virtual sound source based on several heuristic assumptions, while still maintains accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) information of all sound sources. Visualization of oracle beampatterns and directional features shows that FRAM-RIR can generate more realistic RIR filters than existing widely-used ISM-based tools, and experiment results on multi-channel noisy speech separation and dereverberation tasks with a wide range of neural network architectures show that models trained with FRAM-RIR can also achieve on par or better performance on real RIRs compared to other RIR simulation tools with a significantly accelerated training procedure. A Python implementation of FRAM-RIR is released.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08052v1","created":"2023-04-17","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Fast Random Approximation of Multi-channel Room Impulse Response Modern neural-network-based speech processing systems are typically required to be robust against reverberation, and the training of such systems thus needs a large amount of reverberant data.

{"title":"Breaking Common Sense: WHOOPS! A Vision-and-Language Benchmark of Synthetic and Compositional Images","description":"Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual.

A Vision-and-Language Benchmark of Synthetic and Compositional Images Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual.

In this paper, we study the task of training a unified 3D detector from multiple datasets.

Inspired by such observation, we present a Uni3D which leverages a simple data-level correction operation and a designed semantic-level coupling-and-recoupling module to alleviate the unavoidable data-level and taxonomy-level differences, respectively.

{"title":"Backdoor Defense via Deconfounded Representation Learning","description":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are recently shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a few poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD), to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification. Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist potential adaptive attacks.

{"title":"InPL: Pseudo-labeling the Inliers First for Imbalanced Semi-supervised Learning","description":"Recent state-of-the-art methods in imbalanced semi-supervised learning (SSL) rely on confidence-based pseudo-labeling with consistency regularization. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically adopted. However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling for imbalanced SSL. Without relying on model confidence, we propose to measure whether an unlabeled sample is likely to be ``in-distribution''; i.e., close to the current training data. To decide whether an unlabeled sample is ``in-distribution'' or ``out-of-distribution'', we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution detection literature.

The results demonstrate that our xASTNN can improve the state-of-the-art while being faster than the baselines.","classes":{"dataset":0.0144449463,"prompteng":0.0042099734}}
{"title":"Towards smoother surfaces by applying subdivision to voxel data","description":"In computed tomography, the approximation quality of a scan of a physical object is typically limited by the acquisition modalities, especially the hardware including X-ray detectors. To improve upon this, we experiment with a three-dimensional subdivision scheme to increase the resolution of the reconstructed voxel data. Subdivision schemes are often used to refine two-dimensional manifolds (mostly meshes) leading to smoother surfaces. In this work, we apply a refinement scheme to three-dimensional data first, and only then, start the surface extraction process. Thus, the main subject of this work lies not on subdivision surfaces, but rather on subdivision volumes. In the volumetric case, each subdivision iteration consumes eight times more storage space than the previous one. Hence, we restrict ourselves to a single subdivision iteration. We evaluate the quality of the produced subdivision volumes using synthetic and industrial data. Furthermore, we consider manufacturing errors in the original and in the subdivision volumes, extract their surfaces, and compare the resulting meshes in critical regions. Observations show that our specific choice of a subdivision scheme produces smoothly interpolated data while also preserving edges.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07075v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Towards smoother surfaces by applying subdivision to voxel data In computed tomography, the approximation quality of a scan of a physical object is typically limited by the acquisition modalities, especially the hardware including X-ray detectors.

{"title":"Synthesizing Realistic Image Restoration Training Pairs: A Diffusion Approach","description":"In supervised image restoration tasks, one key issue is how to obtain the aligned high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) training image pairs. Unfortunately, such HQ-LQ training pairs are hard to capture in practice, and hard to synthesize due to the complex unknown degradation in the wild. While several sophisticated degradation models have been manually designed to synthesize LQ images from their HQ counterparts, the distribution gap between the synthesized and real-world LQ images remains large. We propose a new approach to synthesizing realistic image restoration training pairs using the emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).   First, we train a DDPM, which could convert a noisy input into the desired LQ image, with a large amount of collected LQ images, which define the target data distribution. Then, for a given HQ image, we synthesize an initial LQ image by using an off-the-shelf degradation model, and iteratively add proper Gaussian noises to it. Finally, we denoise the noisy LQ image using the pre-trained DDPM to obtain the final LQ image, which falls into the target distribution of real-world LQ images. Thanks to the strong capability of DDPM in distribution approximation, the synthesized HQ-LQ image pairs can be used to train robust models for real-world image restoration tasks, such as blind face image restoration and blind image super-resolution. Experiments demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach to existing degradation models. Code and data will be released.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06994v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Synthesizing Realistic Image Restoration Training Pairs: A Diffusion Approach In supervised image restoration tasks, one key issue is how to obtain the aligned high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) training image pairs.

{"title":"Pixel-wise Gradient Uncertainty for Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Out-of-Distribution Segmentation","description":"In recent years, deep neural networks have defined the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation where their predictions are constrained to a predefined set of semantic classes. They are to be deployed in applications such as automated driving, although their categorically confined expressive power runs contrary to such open world scenarios. Thus, the detection and segmentation of objects from outside their predefined semantic space, i.e., out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, is of highest interest. Since uncertainty estimation methods like softmax entropy or Bayesian models are sensitive to erroneous predictions, these methods are a natural baseline for OoD detection. Here, we present a method for obtaining uncertainty scores from pixel-wise loss gradients which can be computed efficiently during inference. Our approach is simple to implement for a large class of models, does not require any additional training or auxiliary data and can be readily used on pre-trained segmentation models. Our experiments show the ability of our method to identify wrong pixel classifications and to estimate prediction quality. In particular, we observe superior performance in terms of OoD segmentation to comparable baselines on the SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmark, clearly outperforming methods which are similarly flexible to implement.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06920v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Pixel-wise Gradient Uncertainty for Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Out-of-Distribution Segmentation In recent years, deep neural networks have defined the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation where their predictions are constrained to a predefined set of semantic classes.

{"title":"ST360IQ: No-Reference Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment with Spherical Vision Transformers","description":"Omnidirectional images, aka 360 images, can deliver immersive and interactive visual experiences. As their popularity has increased dramatically in recent years, evaluating the quality of 360 images has become a problem of interest since it provides insights for capturing, transmitting, and consuming this new media. However, directly adapting quality assessment methods proposed for standard natural images for omnidirectional data poses certain challenges. These models need to deal with very high-resolution data and implicit distortions due to the spherical form of the images. In this study, we present a method for no-reference 360 image quality assessment. Our proposed ST360IQ model extracts tangent viewports from the salient parts of the input omnidirectional image and employs a vision-transformers based module processing saliency selective patches/tokens that estimates a quality score from each viewport. Then, it aggregates these scores to give a final quality score. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely OIQA and CVIQ datasets, demonstrate that as compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach predicts the quality of an omnidirectional image correlated with the human-perceived image quality.

{"title":"Boosting Source Code Learning with Data Augmentation: An Empirical Study","description":"The next era of program understanding is being propelled by the use of machine learning to solve software problems. Recent studies have shown surprising results of source code learning, which applies deep neural networks (DNNs) to various critical software tasks, e.g., bug detection and clone detection. This success can be greatly attributed to the utilization of massive high-quality training data, and in practice, data augmentation, which is a technique used to produce additional training data, has been widely adopted in various domains, such as computer vision. However, in source code learning, data augmentation has not been extensively studied, and existing practice is limited to simple syntax-preserved methods, such as code refactoring. Essentially, source code is often represented in two ways, namely, sequentially as text data and structurally as graph data, when it is used as training data in source code learning. Inspired by these analogy relations, we take an early step to investigate whether data augmentation methods that are originally used for text and graphs are effective in improving the training quality of source code learning. To that end, we first collect and categorize data augmentation methods in the literature. Second, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four critical tasks and 11 DNN architectures to explore the effectiveness of 12 data augmentation methods (including code refactoring and 11 other methods for text and graph data). Our results identify the data augmentation methods that can produce more accurate and robust models for source code learning, including those based on mixup (e.g., SenMixup for texts and Manifold-Mixup for graphs), and those that slightly break the syntax of source code (e.g., random swap and random deletion for texts).","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06808v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Boosting Source Code Learning with Data Augmentation: An Empirical Study The next era of program understanding is being propelled by the use of machine learning to solve software problems.

However, these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: UAVs are limited in their payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements.

Our CGD algorithm is a gradient-descent (GD) method, with the twist that the user can also specify logical properties that characterize the kinds of inputs that the user may want. This functionality sets CGDTest apart from other similar DNN testing tools since it allows users to specify logical constraints to test DNNs not only for $\\ell_p$ ball-based adversarial robustness but, more importantly, includes richer properties such as disguised and flow adversarial constraints, as well as adversarial robustness in the NLP domain. We showcase the utility and power of CGDTest via extensive experimentation in the context of vision and NLP domains, comparing against 32 state-of-the-art methods over these diverse domains. Our results indicate that CGDTest outperforms state-of-the-art testing tools for $\\ell_p$ ball-based adversarial robustness, and is significantly superior in testing for other adversarial robustness, with improvements in PAR2 scores of over 1500% in some cases over the next best tool. Our evaluation shows that our CGD method outperforms competing methods we compared against in terms of expressibility (i.e., a rich constraint language and concomitant tool support to express a wide variety of properties), scalability (i.e., can be applied to very large real-world models with up to 138 million parameters), and generality (i.e., can be used to test a plethora of model architectures).","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01826v1","created":"2023-04-04","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"CGDTest: A Constrained Gradient Descent Algorithm for Testing Neural Networks In this paper, we propose a new Deep Neural Network (DNN) testing algorithm called the Constrained Gradient Descent (CGD) method, and an implementation we call CGDTest aimed at exposing security and robustness issues such as adversarial robustness and bias in DNNs.

Our results indicate that CGDTest outperforms state-of-the-art testing tools for $\\ell_p$ ball-based adversarial robustness, and is significantly superior in testing for other adversarial robustness, with improvements in PAR2 scores of over 1500% in some cases over the next best tool. Our evaluation shows that our CGD method outperforms competing methods we compared against in terms of expressibility (i.e., a rich constraint language and concomitant tool support to express a wide variety of properties), scalability (i.e., can be applied to very large real-world models with up to 138 million parameters), and generality (i.e., can be used to test a plethora of model architectures).","classes":{"dataset":0.0635048896,"prompteng":0.0112848496}}
{"title":"Re-thinking Model Inversion Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks","description":"Model inversion (MI) attacks aim to infer and reconstruct private training data by abusing access to a model. MI attacks have raised concerns about the leaking of sensitive information (e.g. private face images used in training a face recognition system). Recently, several algorithms for MI have been proposed to improve the attack performance. In this work, we revisit MI, study two fundamental issues pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI algorithms, and propose solutions to these issues which lead to a significant boost in attack performance for all SOTA MI. In particular, our contributions are two-fold: 1) We analyze the optimization objective of SOTA MI algorithms, argue that the objective is sub-optimal for achieving MI, and propose an improved optimization objective that boosts attack performance significantly. 2) We analyze \"MI overfitting\", show that it would prevent reconstructed images from learning semantics of training data, and propose a novel \"model augmentation\" idea to overcome this issue. Our proposed solutions are simple and improve all SOTA MI attack accuracy significantly. E.g., in the standard CelebA benchmark, our solutions improve accuracy by 11.8% and achieve for the first time over 90% attack accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that there is a clear risk of leaking sensitive information from deep learning models. We urge serious consideration to be given to the privacy implications.

{"title":"Do Backdoors Assist Membership Inference Attacks?","description":"When an adversary provides poison samples to a machine learning model, privacy leakage, such as membership inference attacks that infer whether a sample was included in the training of the model, becomes effective by moving the sample to an outlier. However, the attacks can be detected because inference accuracy deteriorates due to poison samples. In this paper, we discuss a \\textit{backdoor-assisted membership inference attack}, a novel membership inference attack based on backdoors that return the adversary's expected output for a triggered sample. We found three crucial insights through experiments with an academic benchmark dataset. We first demonstrate that the backdoor-assisted membership inference attack is unsuccessful. Second, when we analyzed loss distributions to understand the reason for the unsuccessful results, we found that backdoors cannot separate loss distributions of training and non-training samples. In other words, backdoors cannot affect the distribution of clean samples. Third, we also show that poison and triggered samples activate neurons of different distributions. Specifically, backdoors make any clean sample an inlier, contrary to poisoning samples. As a result, we confirm that backdoors cannot assist membership inference.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12589v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Do Backdoors Assist Membership Inference Attacks?

{"title":"Revisiting DeepFool: generalization and improvement","description":"Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions. This has led to a significant amount of research on evaluating the robustness of these networks against such perturbations. One particularly important robustness metric is the robustness to minimal l2 adversarial perturbations. However, existing methods for evaluating this robustness metric are either computationally expensive or not very accurate. In this paper, we introduce a new family of adversarial attacks that strike a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are generalizations of the well-known DeepFool (DF) attack, while they remain simple to understand and implement. We demonstrate that our attacks outperform existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are also suitable for evaluating the robustness of large models and can be used to perform adversarial training (AT) to achieve state-of-the-art robustness to minimal l2 adversarial perturbations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12481v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Revisiting DeepFool: generalization and improvement Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions.

{"title":"Distribution-restrained Softmax Loss for the Model Robustness","description":"Recently, the robustness of deep learning models has received widespread attention, and various methods for improving model robustness have been proposed, including adversarial training, model architecture modification, design of loss functions, certified defenses, and so on. However, the principle of the robustness to attacks is still not fully understood, also the related research is still not sufficient. Here, we have identified a significant factor that affects the robustness of models: the distribution characteristics of softmax values for non-real label samples.

However, the principle of the robustness to attacks is still not fully understood, also the related research is still not sufficient. Here, we have identified a significant factor that affects the robustness of models: the distribution characteristics of softmax values for non-real label samples.

{"title":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4","description":"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4 Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition.

{"title":"Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens","description":"In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\\Lambda$CDM.   The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is unable to constrain $\\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected. The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.   The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific form of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system techniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies. Using model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by itself, able to tell this model and $\\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we add current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when compared to the constrains set by the SS events.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12674v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Constraining f(Q) Cosmology with Standard Sirens In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity.

{"title":"Anomaly Detection in Aeronautics Data with Quantum-compatible Discrete Deep Generative Model","description":"Deep generative learning cannot only be used for generating new data with statistical characteristics derived from input data but also for anomaly detection, by separating nominal and anomalous instances based on their reconstruction quality. In this paper, we explore the performance of three unsupervised deep generative models -- variational autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Boltzmann priors -- in detecting anomalies in flight-operations data of commercial flights consisting of multivariate time series. We devised two VAE models with discrete latent variables (DVAEs), one with a factorized Bernoulli prior and one with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) as prior, because of the demand for discrete-variable models in machine-learning applications and because the integration of quantum devices based on two-level quantum systems requires such models. The DVAE with RBM prior, using a relatively simple -- and classically or quantum-mechanically enhanceable -- sampling technique for the evolution of the RBM's negative phase, performed better than the Bernoulli DVAE and on par with the Gaussian model, which has a continuous latent space. Our studies demonstrate the competitiveness of a discrete deep generative model with its Gaussian counterpart on anomaly-detection tasks.

In this paper, we employ ChatGPT as a general-purpose recommendation model to explore its potential for transferring extensive linguistic and world knowledge acquired from large-scale corpora to recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we design a set of prompts and evaluate ChatGPT's performance on five recommendation scenarios. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, we do not fine-tune ChatGPT during the entire evaluation process, relying only on the prompts themselves to convert recommendation tasks into natural language tasks. Further, we explore the use of few-shot prompting to inject interaction information that contains user potential interest to help ChatGPT better understand user needs and interests. Comprehensive experimental results on Amazon Beauty dataset show that ChatGPT has achieved promising results in certain tasks and is capable of reaching the baseline level in others. We conduct human evaluations on two explainability-oriented tasks to more accurately evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models.

{"title":"ZEBRA: Z-order Curve-based Event Retrieval Approach to Efficiently Explore Automotive Data","description":"Evaluating the performance of software for automated vehicles is predominantly driven by data collected from the real world. While professional test drivers are supported with technical means to semi-automatically annotate driving maneuvers to allow better event identification, simple data loggers in large vehicle fleets typically lack automatic and detailed event classification and hence, extra effort is needed when post-processing such data. Yet, the data quality from professional test drivers is apparently higher than the one from large fleets where labels are missing, but the non-annotated data set from large vehicle fleets is much more representative for typical, realistic driving scenarios to be handled by automated vehicles.

While professional test drivers are supported with technical means to semi-automatically annotate driving maneuvers to allow better event identification, simple data loggers in large vehicle fleets typically lack automatic and detailed event classification and hence, extra effort is needed when post-processing such data. Yet, the data quality from professional test drivers is apparently higher than the one from large fleets where labels are missing, but the non-annotated data set from large vehicle fleets is much more representative for typical, realistic driving scenarios to be handled by automated vehicles.

{"title":"Motion Artifacts Detection in Short-scan Dental CBCT Reconstructions","description":"Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dentistry for diagnostics and treatment planning. CBCT Imaging has a long acquisition time and consequently, the patient is likely to move. This motion causes significant artifacts in the reconstructed data which may lead to misdiagnosis. Existing motion correction algorithms only address this issue partially, struggling with inconsistencies due to truncation, accuracy, and execution speed. On the other hand, a short-scan reconstruction using a subset of motion-free projections with appropriate weighting methods can have a sufficient clinical image quality for most diagnostic purposes. Therefore, a framework is used in this study to extract the motion-free part of the scanned projections with which a clean short-scan volume can be reconstructed without using correction algorithms. Motion artifacts are detected using deep learning with a slice-based prediction scheme followed by volume averaging to get the final result. A realistic motion simulation strategy and data augmentation has been implemented to address data scarcity. The framework has been validated by testing it with real motion-affected data while the model was trained only with simulated motion data.

Complete masks can be obtained and projected onto mask grids. This procedure is executed via an iterative manner while accurate 3D masks can be finally learned. SA3D can adapt to various radiance fields effectively without any additional redesigning.

{"title":"Efficient Halftoning via Deep Reinforcement Learning","description":"Halftoning aims to reproduce a continuous-tone image with pixels whose intensities are constrained to two discrete levels. This technique has been deployed on every printer, and the majority of them adopt fast methods (e.g., ordered dithering, error diffusion) that fail to render structural details, which determine halftone's quality. Other prior methods of pursuing visual pleasure by searching for the optimal halftone solution, on the contrary, suffer from their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast and structure-aware halftoning method via a data-driven approach. Specifically, we formulate halftoning as a reinforcement learning problem, in which each binary pixel's value is regarded as an action chosen by a virtual agent with a shared fully convolutional neural network (CNN) policy. In the offline phase, an effective gradient estimator is utilized to train the agents in producing high-quality halftones in one action step. Then, halftones can be generated online by one fast CNN inference. Besides, we propose a novel anisotropy suppressing loss function, which brings the desirable blue-noise property. Finally, we find that optimizing SSIM could result in holes in flat areas, which can be avoided by weighting the metric with the contone's contrast map.

{"title":"UTSGAN: Unseen Transition Suss GAN for Transition-Aware Image-to-image Translation","description":"In the field of Image-to-Image (I2I) translation, ensuring consistency between input images and their translated results is a key requirement for producing high-quality and desirable outputs. Previous I2I methods have relied on result consistency, which enforces consistency between the translated results and the ground truth output, to achieve this goal. However, result consistency is limited in its ability to handle complex and unseen attribute changes in translation tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a transition-aware approach to I2I translation, where the data translation mapping is explicitly parameterized with a transition variable, allowing for the modelling of unobserved translations triggered by unseen transitions. Furthermore, we propose the use of transition consistency, defined on the transition variable, to enable regularization of consistency on unobserved translations, which is omitted in previous works. Based on these insights, we present Unseen Transition Suss GAN (UTSGAN), a generative framework that constructs a manifold for the transition with a stochastic transition encoder and coherently regularizes and generalizes result consistency and transition consistency on both training and unobserved translations with tailor-designed constraints. Extensive experiments on four different I2I tasks performed on five different datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed UTSGAN in performing consistent translations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11955v1","created":"2023-04-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"UTSGAN: Unseen Transition Suss GAN for Transition-Aware Image-to-image Translation In the field of Image-to-Image (I2I) translation, ensuring consistency between input images and their translated results is a key requirement for producing high-quality and desirable outputs. Previous I2I methods have relied on result consistency, which enforces consistency between the translated results and the ground truth output, to achieve this goal. However, result consistency is limited in its ability to handle complex and unseen attribute changes in translation tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a transition-aware approach to I2I translation, where the data translation mapping is explicitly parameterized with a transition variable, allowing for the modelling of unobserved translations triggered by unseen transitions. Furthermore, we propose the use of transition consistency, defined on the transition variable, to enable regularization of consistency on unobserved translations, which is omitted in previous works. Based on these insights, we present Unseen Transition Suss GAN (UTSGAN), a generative framework that constructs a manifold for the transition with a stochastic transition encoder and coherently regularizes and generalizes result consistency and transition consistency on both training and unobserved translations with tailor-designed constraints.

{"title":"The Design and Implementation of a National AI Platform for Public Healthcare in Italy: Implications for Semantics and Interoperability","description":"The Italian National Health Service is adopting Artificial Intelligence through its technical agencies, with the twofold objective of supporting and facilitating the diagnosis and treatment. Such a vast programme requires special care in formalising the knowledge domain, leveraging domain-specific data spaces and addressing data governance issues from an interoperability perspective. The healthcare data governance and interoperability legal framework is characterised by the interplay of different pieces of legislation. Data law is the first to be taken into proper account. It primarily includes the GDPR, the Data Governance Act, and the Open Data Directive. Also, the Data Act and the European Health Data Space proposals will have an impact on health data sharing and therefore must be considered as well. The platform developed by the Italian NHL will have to be integrated in a harmonised manner with the systems already used in the healthcare system and with the digital assets (data and software) used by healthcare professionals. Questions have been raised about the impact that AI could have on patients, practitioners, and health systems, as well as about its potential risks; therefore, all the parties involved are called to agree upon to express a common view based on the dual purpose of improving people's quality of life and keeping the whole healthcare system sustainable for society as a whole.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11893v1","created":"2023-04-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"The Design and Implementation of a National AI Platform for Public Healthcare in Italy: Implications for Semantics and Interoperability The Italian National Health Service is adopting Artificial Intelligence through its technical agencies, with the twofold objective of supporting and facilitating the diagnosis and treatment.

However, since task offloading toward the cloud will cause a large delay, vehicular edge computing (VEC) is introduced to avoid such a problem and improve the whole system performance, where a roadside unit (RSU) with certain computing capability is used to process the data of vehicles as an edge entity. Owing to the privacy and security issues, vehicles are reluctant to upload local data directly to the RSU, and thus federated learning (FL) becomes a promising technology for some machine learning tasks in VEC, where vehicles only need to upload the local model hyperparameters instead of transferring their local data to the nearby RSU. Furthermore, as vehicles have different local training time due to various sizes of local data and their different computing capabilities, asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is employed to facilitate the RSU to update the global model immediately after receiving a local model to reduce the aggregation delay.

{"title":"GPT detectors are biased against non-native English writers","description":"The rapid adoption of generative language models has brought about substantial advancements in digital communication, while simultaneously raising concerns regarding the potential misuse of AI-generated content. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed to differentiate between AI and human-generated content, the fairness and robustness of these detectors remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several widely-used GPT detectors using writing samples from native and non-native English writers. Our findings reveal that these detectors consistently misclassify non-native English writing samples as AI-generated, whereas native writing samples are accurately identified. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple prompting strategies can not only mitigate this bias but also effectively bypass GPT detectors, suggesting that GPT detectors may unintentionally penalize writers with constrained linguistic expressions. Our results call for a broader conversation about the ethical implications of deploying ChatGPT content detectors and caution against their use in evaluative or educational settings, particularly when they may inadvertently penalize or exclude non-native English speakers from the global discourse.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819v1","created":"2023-04-06","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"GPT detectors are biased against non-native English writers The rapid adoption of generative language models has brought about substantial advancements in digital communication, while simultaneously raising concerns regarding the potential misuse of AI-generated content.

{"title":"TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers","description":"Tags are pivotal in facilitating the effective distribution of multimedia content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as search engines and recommendation systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications. We evaluate TagGPT on publicly available datasets, i.e., Kuaishou and Food.com, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TagGPT compared to existing hashtags and off-the-shelf taggers.

{"title":"Diffusion Models as Masked Autoencoders","description":"There has been a longstanding belief that generation can facilitate a true understanding of visual data. In line with this, we revisit generatively pre-training visual representations in light of recent interest in denoising diffusion models.

Our approach is capable of (i) serving as a strong initialization for downstream recognition tasks, (ii) conducting high-quality image inpainting, and (iii) being effortlessly extended to video where it produces state-of-the-art classification accuracy.

{"title":"A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation","description":"Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a complex task that involves accurately segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then, using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models.

{"title":"MULLER: Multilayer Laplacian Resizer for Vision","description":"Image resizing operation is a fundamental preprocessing module in modern computer vision. Throughout the deep learning revolution, researchers have overlooked the potential of alternative resizing methods beyond the commonly used resizers that are readily available, such as nearest-neighbors, bilinear, and bicubic. The key question of our interest is whether the front-end resizer affects the performance of deep vision models? In this paper, we present an extremely lightweight multilayer Laplacian resizer with only a handful of trainable parameters, dubbed MULLER resizer. MULLER has a bandpass nature in that it learns to boost details in certain frequency subbands that benefit the downstream recognition models. We show that MULLER can be easily plugged into various training pipelines, and it effectively boosts the performance of the underlying vision task with little to no extra cost. Specifically, we select a state-of-the-art vision Transformer, MaxViT, as the baseline, and show that, if trained with MULLER, MaxViT gains up to 0.6% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 36% inference cost saving to achieve similar top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k, as compared to the standard training scheme. Notably, MULLER's performance also scales with model size and training data size such as ImageNet-21k and JFT, and it is widely applicable to multiple vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and segmentation, as well as image quality assessment.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02859v1","created":"2023-04-06","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"MULLER: Multilayer Laplacian Resizer for Vision Image resizing operation is a fundamental preprocessing module in modern computer vision.
