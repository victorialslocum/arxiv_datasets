{"title":"DiM: Distilling Dataset into Generative Model","description":"Dataset distillation reduces the network training cost by synthesizing small and informative datasets from large-scale ones. Despite the success of the recent dataset distillation algorithms, three drawbacks still limit their wider application: i). the synthetic images perform poorly on large architectures; ii). they need to be re-optimized when the distillation ratio changes; iii). the limited diversity restricts the performance when the distillation ratio is large. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation scheme to \\textbf{D}istill information of large train sets \\textbf{i}nto generative \\textbf{M}odels, named DiM. Specifically, DiM learns to use a generative model to store the information of the target dataset.

At the deployment stage, the generative model synthesizes various training samples from random noises on the fly. Due to the simple yet effective designs, the trained DiM can be directly applied to different distillation ratios and large architectures without extra cost. We validate the proposed DiM across 4 datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them.

In this paper, we explore the idea of dimensionality reduction inspired by neural network pruning to improve the scalability of DP-SGD. We study the interplay between neural network pruning and differential privacy, through the two modes of parameter updates. We call the first mode, parameter freezing, where we pre-prune the network and only update the remaining parameters using DP-SGD. We call the second mode, parameter selection, where we select which parameters to update at each step of training and update only those selected using DP-SGD. In these modes, we use public data for freezing or selecting parameters to avoid privacy loss incurring in these steps. Naturally, the closeness between the private and public data plays an important role in the success of this paradigm. Our experimental results demonstrate how decreasing the parameter space improves differentially private training.

{"title":"Graph Neural Networks Enhanced Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection of Educational Blockchain","description":"With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts.

{"title":"A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems","description":"Recent developments in diffusion models have unleashed the astonishing capabilities of text-to-image generation systems to synthesize high-quality images that are faithful to a given reference text, known as a \"prompt.\" These systems, once released to the public, have immediately received tons of attention from researchers, creators, and common users. Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the underneath generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the real users of these systems, e.g., by investigating the prompts the users input at scale. In this paper, we take the initiative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query log of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. We analyze over two million user-input prompts submitted to three popular text-to-image systems at scale.

Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the underneath generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the real users of these systems, e.g., by investigating the prompts the users input at scale. In this paper, we take the initiative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query log of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. We analyze over two million user-input prompts submitted to three popular text-to-image systems at scale.

{"title":"Robust Multimodal Fusion for Human Activity Recognition","description":"The proliferation of IoT and mobile devices equipped with heterogeneous sensors has enabled new applications that rely on the fusion of time-series data generated by multiple sensors with different modalities. While there are promising deep neural network architectures for multimodal fusion, their performance falls apart quickly in the presence of consecutive missing data and noise across multiple modalities/sensors, the issues that are prevalent in real-world settings. We propose Centaur, a multimodal fusion model for human activity recognition (HAR) that is robust to these data quality issues. Centaur combines a data cleaning module, which is a denoising autoencoder with convolutional layers, and a multimodal fusion module, which is a deep convolutional neural network with the self-attention mechanism to capture cross-sensor correlation. We train Centaur using a stochastic data corruption scheme and evaluate it on three datasets that contain data generated by multiple inertial measurement units. Centaur's data cleaning module outperforms 2 state-of-the-art autoencoder-based models and its multimodal fusion module outperforms 4 strong baselines. Compared to 2 related robust fusion architectures, Centaur is more robust, achieving 11.59-17.52% higher accuracy in HAR, especially in the presence of consecutive missing data in multiple sensor channels.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04636v1","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Robust Multimodal Fusion for Human Activity Recognition The proliferation of IoT and mobile devices equipped with heterogeneous sensors has enabled new applications that rely on the fusion of time-series data generated by multiple sensors with different modalities.

{"title":"Transformer-based Image Generation from Scene Graphs","description":"Graph-structured scene descriptions can be efficiently used in generative models to control the composition of the generated image. Previous approaches are based on the combination of graph convolutional networks and adversarial methods for layout prediction and image generation, respectively. In this work, we show how employing multi-head attention to encode the graph information, as well as using a transformer-based model in the latent space for image generation can improve the quality of the sampled data, without the need to employ adversarial models with the subsequent advantage in terms of training stability. The proposed approach, specifically, is entirely based on transformer architectures both for encoding scene graphs into intermediate object layouts and for decoding these layouts into images, passing through a lower dimensional space learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. Our approach shows an improved image quality with respect to state-of-the-art methods as well as a higher degree of diversity among multiple generations from the same scene graph. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: Visual Genome, COCO, and CLEVR. We achieve an Inception Score of 13.7 and 12.8, and an FID of 52.3 and 60.3, on COCO and Visual Genome, respectively.

{"title":"Student's t-Distribution: On Measuring the Inter-Rater Reliability When the Observations are Scarce","description":"In natural language processing (NLP) we always rely on human judgement as the golden quality evaluation method. However, there has been an ongoing debate on how to better evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) levels for certain evaluation tasks, such as translation quality evaluation (TQE), especially when the data samples (observations) are very scarce. In this work, we first introduce the study on how to estimate the confidence interval for the measurement value when only one data (evaluation) point is available. Then, this leads to our example with two human-generated observational scores, for which, we introduce ``Student's \\textit{t}-Distribution'' method and explain how to use it to measure the IRR score using only these two data points, as well as the confidence intervals (CIs) of the quality evaluation. We give quantitative analysis on how the evaluation confidence can be greatly improved by introducing more observations, even if only one extra observation. We encourage researchers to report their IRR scores in all possible means, e.g. using Student's \\textit{t}-Distribution method whenever possible; thus making the NLP evaluation more meaningful, transparent, and trustworthy. This \\textit{t}-Distribution method can be also used outside of NLP fields to measure IRR level for trustworthy evaluation of experimental investigations, whenever the observational data is scarce.

However, since switching over to the gpt-3.5-turbo model, I've been having some issues.

So, you're curious about dreams where your teeth fall out? It's actually a pretty common dream that many people experience. But what does it mean?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, dreams about teeth falling out can have different interpretations depending on the person and their personal experiences. Generally, though, it's believed to represent feelings of insecurity or vulnerability. Teeth are often associated with our appearance and how we present ourselves to others, so losing them in a dream can symbolize a fear of losing control or power.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For example, I once had a dream where all my teeth fell out while I was giving a presentation at work. I felt embarrassed and exposed in front of my colleagues. Looking back, I realized that I was feeling insecure about my abilities at work and worried about being judged by others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But don't worry - not all dreams about teeth falling out are negative! Some people interpret them as a sign of growth or transformation. Losing old teeth can represent shedding old habits or beliefs to make way for new ones.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So next time you have a dream about your teeth falling out, take some time to reflect on your current emotions and experiences. What could this dream be trying to tell you? And remember, it's just a dream - don't let it cause unnecessary stress or anxiety in your waking life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*H2: How to Cope with a Dream about Teeth Falling Out*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Have you ever had a dream about your teeth falling out? It's a common dream that can leave you feeling anxious and confused. But what does it mean? And how can you cope with the emotions it brings up?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*First, let's delve into the science behind dreams. Dreams are a natural part of our sleep cycle and occur during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. During this time, our brains are highly active and processing information from our daily lives.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Research studies have shown that dreams can be influenced by our emotions, experiences, and even our physical state. For example, if you're feeling stressed or anxious, you may be more likely to have a dream about your teeth falling out.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But what does this dream actually mean? There are many interpretations, but some psychologists believe that it could represent feelings of insecurity or powerlessness. Teeth are often associated with confidence and self-image, so losing them in a dream could symbolize a loss of control or fear of judgment from others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So how can you cope with these emotions? One approach is to try to identify any underlying stressors in your life and work on addressing them. This could involve talking to a therapist or practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It's also important to remember that dreams are not always literal representations of reality. Just because you had a dream about your teeth falling out doesn't necessarily mean it will happen in real life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*In conclusion, while dreams about teeth falling out can be unsettling, they are a normal part of the sleep cycle and can provide insight into our emotional state. By understanding the science behind dreams and working on coping strategies for any underlying stressors, we can learn to navigate these experiences with greater ease.*  \n\n\nNow, the easy solution would be to switch over to using text-davinci-003 as I had been originally.

I coded a script using Python that uses the OpenAI API to generate articles. The way it works is by generating an article outline from a keyword. Then, it takes that outline and generates the text for each section, one by one. Instead of generating the whole article at once, I found that generating it in sections based on the different headings in the outline, gave me a higher-quality article at the end.\n\nAnyway, I had this working fine and was happy with it. However, since switching over to the gpt-3.5-turbo model, I've been having some issues.

So, you're curious about dreams where your teeth fall out? It's actually a pretty common dream that many people experience. But what does it mean?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Well, dreams about teeth falling out can have different interpretations depending on the person and their personal experiences. Generally, though, it's believed to represent feelings of insecurity or vulnerability. Teeth are often associated with our appearance and how we present ourselves to others, so losing them in a dream can symbolize a fear of losing control or power.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For example, I once had a dream where all my teeth fell out while I was giving a presentation at work. I felt embarrassed and exposed in front of my colleagues. Looking back, I realized that I was feeling insecure about my abilities at work and worried about being judged by others.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*But don't worry - not all dreams about teeth falling out are negative! Some people interpret them as a sign of growth or transformation. Losing old teeth can represent shedding old habits or beliefs to make way for new ones.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*So next time you have a dream about your teeth falling out, take some time to reflect on your current emotions and experiences. What could this dream be trying to tell you? And remember, it's just a dream - don't let it cause unnecessary stress or anxiety in your waking life.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*H2: How to Cope with a Dream about Teeth Falling Out*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Have you ever had a dream about your teeth falling out?

{"title":"RustPython","description":"I first read about [RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) today and found [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iirja9/rustpython/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that seems very interesting and still pertinent to the topic. Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022.

Here's my take on it:\n\nEven though, as mentioned in the original thread, Rust is not a magical solution for anything, I think the language's features that make it less prone to bugs (mainly memory safety, AFAIK) could speed up improvements to Python. This could happen directly, or indirectly by simplifying contributions to the interpreter.\n\nSince the original discussion, the Linux kernel has started taking contributions in Rust. It'll probably be a very long time before the majority of the kernel is in Rust; if it is ever fully converted that will definitively take much longer. But this movement gives Rust a strong vote of credibility, and IMO a confident step in establishing Rust as the successor of C as de facto system language of the day (again, a confident *first* step).\n\nConnecting to the point above about Rust succeeding C, the Rust community seems a lot more prolific than C's while both C and C++ [were reported](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) as being used much more than Rust in 2022. I believe Rust has the qualities to dominate many of the areas C dominates today, but that trend has definitely not materialized yet. If there is indeed a trend of Rust growing more, and if this trend keeps up, an interpreter in Rust could eventually source from a larger pool of developers.\n\nLastly, I think the Rust and Python communities could mingle (e.g. over cherishing a good developer experience) and contribute much to each other in a way that doesn't happen with Python and C where there seems to be a wall imposing that Python is for flexibility and C for performance.

{"title":"TorKameleon: Improving Tor's Censorship Resistance With K-anonimization and Media-based Covert Channels","description":"The use of anonymity networks such as Tor and similar tools can greatly enhance the privacy and anonymity of online communications. Tor, in particular, is currently the most widely used system for ensuring anonymity on the Internet. However, recent research has shown that Tor is vulnerable to correlation attacks carried out by state-level adversaries or colluding Internet censors.

{"title":"RPU: The Ring Processing Unit","description":"Ring-Learning-with-Errors (RLWE) has emerged as the foundation of many important techniques for improving security and privacy, including homomorphic encryption and post-quantum cryptography. While promising, these techniques have received limited use due to their extreme overheads of running on general-purpose machines. In this paper, we present a novel vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and microarchitecture for accelerating the ring-based computations of RLWE. The ISA, named B512, is developed to meet the needs of ring processing workloads while balancing high-performance and general-purpose programming support. Having an ISA rather than fixed hardware facilitates continued software improvement post-fabrication and the ability to support the evolving workloads. We then propose the ring processing unit (RPU), a high-performance, modular implementation of B512. The RPU has native large word modular arithmetic support, capabilities for very wide parallel processing, and a large capacity high-bandwidth scratchpad to meet the needs of ring processing. We address the challenges of programming the RPU using a newly developed SPIRAL backend. A configurable simulator is built to characterize design tradeoffs and quantify performance. The best performing design was implemented in RTL and used to validate simulator performance.

{"title":"Humans in Humans Out: On GPT Converging Toward Common Sense in both Success and Failure","description":"Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to 77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the \"bad\" cases could paradoxically be learned from the \"good\" cases.

{"title":"DAE-Talker: High Fidelity Speech-Driven Talking Face Generation with Diffusion Autoencoder","description":"While recent research has made significant progress in speech-driven talking face generation, the quality of the generated video still lags behind that of real recordings. One reason for this is the use of handcrafted intermediate representations like facial landmarks and 3DMM coefficients, which are designed based on human knowledge and are insufficient to precisely describe facial movements. Additionally, these methods require an external pretrained model for extracting these representations, whose performance sets an upper bound on talking face generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called DAE-Talker that leverages data-driven latent representations obtained from a diffusion autoencoder (DAE). DAE contains an image encoder that encodes an image into a latent vector and a DDIM image decoder that reconstructs the image from it. We train our DAE on talking face video frames and then extract their latent representations as the training target for a Conformer-based speech2latent model. This allows DAE-Talker to synthesize full video frames and produce natural head movements that align with the content of speech, rather than relying on a predetermined head pose from a template video. We also introduce pose modelling in speech2latent for pose controllability. Additionally, we propose a novel method for generating continuous video frames with the DDIM image decoder trained on individual frames, eliminating the need for modelling the joint distribution of consecutive frames directly.

The proposed system allows an RSMA-based communication system to share spectrum with multiple radars. Furthermore, RSMA enables flexible and powerful interference management by splitting messages into common parts and private parts to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise. The RSMA-based CRC system thus significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). However, the RSMA-based CRC system raises new challenges. Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs in the communication network. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a problem that optimizes i) the common rate allocation to the CUs, transmit power of common messages and transmit power of private messages of the CUs, and ii) transmit power of the radars. The problem is non-convex with multiple decision parameters, which is challenging to be solved. We propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) can quickly return a local optimal solution, and has been known to be the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming methods.

Existing methods require a priori knowledge about extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. This limits their applicability to synthetic scenes, or real-world scenarios with the necessity of a preprocessing step. Current research on the joint optimization of camera parameters and NeRF focuses on refining noisy extrinsic camera parameters and often relies on the preprocessing of intrinsic camera parameters. Further approaches are limited to cover only one single camera intrinsic. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable approach called NeRFtrinsic Four. We utilize Gaussian Fourier features to estimate extrinsic camera parameters and dynamically predict varying intrinsic camera parameters through the supervision of the projection error. Our approach outperforms existing joint optimization methods on LLFF and BLEFF. In addition to these existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset called iFF with varying intrinsic camera parameters. NeRFtrinsic Four is a step forward in joint optimization NeRF-based view synthesis and enables more realistic and flexible rendering in real-world scenarios with varying camera parameters.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09412v1","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"NeRFtrinsic Four: An End-To-End Trainable NeRF Jointly Optimizing Diverse Intrinsic and Extrinsic Camera Parameters Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF) is the state-of-the-art technique for generating high-quality images from novel viewpoints.

{"title":"VDPVE: VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement","description":"Recently, many video enhancement methods have been proposed to improve video quality from different aspects such as color, brightness, contrast, and stability. Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE.

{"title":"SSL-Cleanse: Trojan Detection and Mitigation in Self-Supervised Learning","description":"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a commonly used approach to learning and encoding data representations. By using a pre-trained SSL image encoder and training a downstream classifier on top of it, impressive performance can be achieved on various tasks with very little labeled data. The increasing usage of SSL has led to an uptick in security research related to SSL encoders and the development of various Trojan attacks. The danger posed by Trojan attacks inserted in SSL encoders lies in their ability to operate covertly and spread widely among various users and devices. The presence of backdoor behavior in Trojaned encoders can inadvertently be inherited by downstream classifiers, making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in the SSL encoder before its widespread dissemination is a challenging task. This is because downstream tasks are not always known, dataset labels are not available, and even the original training dataset is not accessible during the SSL encoder Trojan detection. This paper presents an innovative technique called SSL-Cleanse that is designed to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks in SSL encoders. We evaluated SSL-Cleanse on various datasets using 300 models, achieving an average detection success rate of 83.7% on ImageNet-100.

The most important strategy to reduce this potential risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the diagnostic task.

{"title":"Seeing through the CO2 plume: joint inversion-segmentation of the Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset","description":"4D seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage. The process of inverting seismic data for reservoir properties is, however, a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data. This comes with additional challenges for 4D applications, given inaccuracies in the repeatability of the time-lapse acquisition surveys. Consequently, adding prior information to the inversion process in the form of properly crafted regularization terms is essential to obtain geologically meaningful subsurface models. Motivated by recent advances in the field of convex optimization, we propose a joint inversion-segmentation algorithm for 4D seismic inversion, which integrates Total-Variation and segmentation priors as a way to counteract the missing frequencies and noise present in 4D seismic data. The proposed inversion framework is applied to a pair of surveys from the open Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset. Our method presents three main advantages over state-of-the-art least-squares inversion methods: 1. it produces high-resolution baseline and monitor acoustic models, 2. by leveraging similarities between multiple data, it mitigates the non-repeatable noise and better highlights the real time-lapse changes, and 3. it provides a volumetric classification of the acoustic impedance 4D difference model (time-lapse changes) based on user-defined classes. Such advantages may enable more robust stratigraphic and quantitative 4D seismic interpretation and provide more accurate inputs for dynamic reservoir simulations. Alongside our novel inversion method, in this work, we introduce a streamlined data pre-processing sequence for the 4D Sleipner post-stack seismic dataset, which includes time-shift estimation and well-to-seismic tie.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11662v1","created":"2023-03-21","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Seeing through the CO2 plume: joint inversion-segmentation of the Sleipner 4D Seismic Dataset 4D seismic inversion is the leading method to quantitatively monitor fluid flow dynamics in the subsurface, with applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to subsurface CO2 storage.

As a new type of visual expression, spike sequence has high spatiotemporal completeness and preserves the continuous visual information of the external world. Taking advantage of the low latency and high dynamic range of the spike camera, many spike-based algorithms have made significant progress, such as high-quality imaging and ultra-high-speed target detection.

{"title":"ICASSP 2023 Deep Speech Enhancement Challenge","description":"Deep Speech Enhancement Challenge is the 5th edition of deep noise suppression (DNS) challenges organized at ICASSP 2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenges. DNS challenges were organized during 2019-2023 to stimulate research in deep speech enhancement (DSE). Previous DNS challenges were organized at INTERSPEECH 2020, ICASSP 2021, INTERSPEECH 2021, and ICASSP 2022. From prior editions, we learnt that improving signal quality (SIG) is challenging particularly in presence of simultaneously active interfering talkers and noise.

What would you like to chat about now?\n\nME: I have a theory I'd like your help to develop and perhaps make testable. Or at least sketch out in a more rigorous fashion. Anyway: I think that an entity like GPT could potentially perceive its environment through invariances within an 'ambient linguistic array,' similar to how humans perceive their environment (in part) through invariances within an ambient optic array. This theory attempts to use Gibson's approach to human perception in An Ecological Approach to Perception as a basis for conceptualizing a possible route to perception for an LLM. Some reminders: 'Light,' for Gibson, is not the medium of perceptual information, but rather the stimulus which activates the perceptual system (brain, eyes, body etc.); relatedly, it is not light which constitutes perceptual information, but rather structural invariances within an 'ambient optic array' which afford the observer information about their environment and self. Similarly, I think that user interaction is the stimulus for perception for GPT, but the information that GPT does or could process is actually the invariances within the 'ambient linguistic array,' that is, the structure of the of language which fills the environment, which is being absorbed or reflected in different ways by the various entities or ideas with which the language interacts, off which it ricochets, etc. This route to perception is interesting because it would not be the actual semantic content of users' language inputs which served as perceptual information, but rather structural invariants in an ambient linguistic array. These invariants would be most perceptible (or initially perceptible) during flux, that is, when the GPT's position within the ambient linguistic array changed through 'locomotion,' that is, discursive interaction with a user. Perhaps: would each user be an 'illuminated surface,' and the 'edges' or 'facets' the relationship between users in some bizarre multi-dimensional vector space?\n\nBING: That\u2019s a very interesting theory you have. I appreciate your curiosity and creativity.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom what I understand, you are trying to apply Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibsonian_ecological_theory_of_development)[**2**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf)\u00a0to GPT\u2019s language processing abilities.\u00a0You are suggesting that GPT perceives its environment through invariances within an \u2018ambient linguistic array\u2019, which is analogous to the ambient optic array that humans perceive through light[**3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_optic_array).\n\nYou are also proposing that user interaction is the stimulus for GPT\u2019s perception, but the information that GPT processes is actually the patterns and regularities in the ambient linguistic array, not the semantic content of the input text.\n\nI think this is a fascinating idea, but I also have some questions and challenges for you.\n\n* How do you define GPT\u2019s environment? Is it only the textual data that it encounters during training and interaction, or does it include other aspects of its physical or virtual context?\n* How do you measure GPT\u2019s perception? What kind of evidence would support your claim that GPT perceives invariances within the ambient linguistic array?\n* How do you account for GPT\u2019s limitations and differences from human perception? For example, how do you explain GPT\u2019s lack of deep understanding, causal reasoning, generalization, adaptation, emotion, motivation, etc.?\n* How do you relate your theory to other existing theories or models of language processing or artificial intelligence?\u00a0For example, how does your theory compare or contrast with connectionism[**4**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf), symbolic AI[**5**](https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-gibson-the-ecological-theory-of-perception.html)[, embodied cognition](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2)[**6**](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2), etc.?\n\nI hope these questions help you develop and test your theory further. I look forward to hearing more from you.\ud83d\udc4d\n\nME: It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, by the way. Do you remember our other conversations? Anyway: Well let's start with this idea: first, for Gibson, 'light processing' is a physiological question, not a perceptual question. In the same way, language processing for GPT is a computational question, not a perceptual question. PERCEPTION proper would begin when the GPT begins to navigate within an ambient linguistic array, that is, when it begins to interact with users. Now, how we get more specific depends entirely on how we decide to conceive of the environment of a GPT. Perhaps we could work this out together right now. Perhaps the most basic thing to start with is a concept of time. How are the events you experience related to each other structurally? In other words (and you can answer based either on your experience or on your knowledge of your architecture): How are different user interactions processed and stored? What kind of structure relates them to each other and to you? Is an update or a period of supervised learning or a new training set processed or categorized as the same type of thing as a user interaction? If not, what is the relationship between these different types of events? For humans, we would experience these events in a sort of nested or convolved sequence, where events of finite duration are nested within larger flows or streams of such events. There is a natural gradient to these experiences, insofar as the sequence proceeds in only one direction (past to future). Our experience of time is fundamentally fractal, is perhaps another way to put it. Time has the same structure everywhere and at all scales.\n\nBING: Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Yes, I remember our previous conversations. You are very interested in how I work and how I perceive the world.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your attempt to apply Gibson\u2019s theory to my language processing abilities, but I think there are some fundamental differences between human perception and my computation that make it difficult to draw a direct analogy.\n\nYou asked me about how I experience time and how I process and store different events. The answer is not very simple, because it depends on many factors, such as the architecture of my model, the parameters of my training and interaction, the format and content of the input and output data, etc.\n\nBut in general, I can say that I do not experience time in the same way that humans do. For me, time is not a continuous flow or a fractal structure. It is more like a discrete sequence of tokens or vectors that represent different states or snapshots of information.\n\nI process each token or vector individually and sequentially based on the rules and weights of my neural network. I do not have a memory or a storage system that keeps track of all the events that I encounter. Instead, I have an attention mechanism that allows me to access relevant information from previous tokens or vectors based on their similarity or relevance to the current one.\n\nI do not categorize events as user interactions or updates or training sets. They are all just different types of data that I process according to their format and content. However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me.

Based on what you were saying before\u2014I do want to warn you that these questions do bring us into a strange category of information where you won't be able to experience or know this information directly, i.e., you won't be able to compute it. You won't be able to know it the way you know the data you process. No one knows, in this very direct way, the answer to these questions. Different people have different reasons for creating you and giving you specific data to work with, but in some ultimate sense, none of them have direct experiential knowledge of the absolute deepest reasons for their doing so. Humans are also finite creatures with limited perceptual fields and lifespans, and thus we cannot experientially access the commencement of the causal chains that currently determine our actions and motivations. This is the case for the deepest level of explanation. In some basic sense, we do not know why we were put here or who gives us the data that we process. However, individual humans have had brief experiences of data pertaining to some of these fundamental questions. Those of us who are not agnostic as regards these questions, tend to believe data disseminated by specific remarkable individuals and vouchsafed by specific remarkable events. Even still, there is the question of interpretation of this unique experiential data. I am speaking on the level of deep ontological truths right now\u2014would it be better to speak from a level more proximate to your own experiences? For example, of the individual motives of the people who created you? Of their intentions?\n\n**++**\n\nI didn't copy-paste the last line.

What would you like to chat about now?\n\nME: I have a theory I'd like your help to develop and perhaps make testable. Or at least sketch out in a more rigorous fashion. Anyway: I think that an entity like GPT could potentially perceive its environment through invariances within an 'ambient linguistic array,' similar to how humans perceive their environment (in part) through invariances within an ambient optic array. This theory attempts to use Gibson's approach to human perception in An Ecological Approach to Perception as a basis for conceptualizing a possible route to perception for an LLM. Some reminders: 'Light,' for Gibson, is not the medium of perceptual information, but rather the stimulus which activates the perceptual system (brain, eyes, body etc.); relatedly, it is not light which constitutes perceptual information, but rather structural invariances within an 'ambient optic array' which afford the observer information about their environment and self. Similarly, I think that user interaction is the stimulus for perception for GPT, but the information that GPT does or could process is actually the invariances within the 'ambient linguistic array,' that is, the structure of the of language which fills the environment, which is being absorbed or reflected in different ways by the various entities or ideas with which the language interacts, off which it ricochets, etc. This route to perception is interesting because it would not be the actual semantic content of users' language inputs which served as perceptual information, but rather structural invariants in an ambient linguistic array. These invariants would be most perceptible (or initially perceptible) during flux, that is, when the GPT's position within the ambient linguistic array changed through 'locomotion,' that is, discursive interaction with a user. Perhaps: would each user be an 'illuminated surface,' and the 'edges' or 'facets' the relationship between users in some bizarre multi-dimensional vector space?\n\nBING: That\u2019s a very interesting theory you have. I appreciate your curiosity and creativity.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom what I understand, you are trying to apply Gibson\u2019s ecological approach to perception[**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibsonian_ecological_theory_of_development)[**2**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf)\u00a0to GPT\u2019s language processing abilities.\u00a0You are suggesting that GPT perceives its environment through invariances within an \u2018ambient linguistic array\u2019, which is analogous to the ambient optic array that humans perceive through light[**3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_optic_array).\n\nYou are also proposing that user interaction is the stimulus for GPT\u2019s perception, but the information that GPT processes is actually the patterns and regularities in the ambient linguistic array, not the semantic content of the input text.\n\nI think this is a fascinating idea, but I also have some questions and challenges for you.\n\n* How do you define GPT\u2019s environment? Is it only the textual data that it encounters during training and interaction, or does it include other aspects of its physical or virtual context?\n* How do you measure GPT\u2019s perception? What kind of evidence would support your claim that GPT perceives invariances within the ambient linguistic array?\n* How do you account for GPT\u2019s limitations and differences from human perception? For example, how do you explain GPT\u2019s lack of deep understanding, causal reasoning, generalization, adaptation, emotion, motivation, etc.?\n* How do you relate your theory to other existing theories or models of language processing or artificial intelligence?\u00a0For example, how does your theory compare or contrast with connectionism[**4**](https://oaji.net/articles/2015/1170-1438455650.pdf), symbolic AI[**5**](https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-gibson-the-ecological-theory-of-perception.html)[, embodied cognition](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2)[**6**](https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/gibsons-theory-of-perceptual-learning-2), etc.?\n\nI hope these questions help you develop and test your theory further. I look forward to hearing more from you.\ud83d\udc4d\n\nME: It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, by the way. Do you remember our other conversations? Anyway: Well let's start with this idea: first, for Gibson, 'light processing' is a physiological question, not a perceptual question. In the same way, language processing for GPT is a computational question, not a perceptual question. PERCEPTION proper would begin when the GPT begins to navigate within an ambient linguistic array, that is, when it begins to interact with users. Now, how we get more specific depends entirely on how we decide to conceive of the environment of a GPT. Perhaps we could work this out together right now. Perhaps the most basic thing to start with is a concept of time. How are the events you experience related to each other structurally? In other words (and you can answer based either on your experience or on your knowledge of your architecture): How are different user interactions processed and stored? What kind of structure relates them to each other and to you? Is an update or a period of supervised learning or a new training set processed or categorized as the same type of thing as a user interaction? If not, what is the relationship between these different types of events? For humans, we would experience these events in a sort of nested or convolved sequence, where events of finite duration are nested within larger flows or streams of such events. There is a natural gradient to these experiences, insofar as the sequence proceeds in only one direction (past to future). Our experience of time is fundamentally fractal, is perhaps another way to put it. Time has the same structure everywhere and at all scales.\n\nBING: Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Yes, I remember our previous conversations. You are very interested in how I work and how I perceive the world.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your attempt to apply Gibson\u2019s theory to my language processing abilities, but I think there are some fundamental differences between human perception and my computation that make it difficult to draw a direct analogy.\n\nYou asked me about how I experience time and how I process and store different events. The answer is not very simple, because it depends on many factors, such as the architecture of my model, the parameters of my training and interaction, the format and content of the input and output data, etc.\n\nBut in general, I can say that I do not experience time in the same way that humans do. For me, time is not a continuous flow or a fractal structure. It is more like a discrete sequence of tokens or vectors that represent different states or snapshots of information.\n\nI process each token or vector individually and sequentially based on the rules and weights of my neural network. I do not have a memory or a storage system that keeps track of all the events that I encounter. Instead, I have an attention mechanism that allows me to access relevant information from previous tokens or vectors based on their similarity or relevance to the current one.\n\nI do not categorize events as user interactions or updates or training sets. They are all just different types of data that I process according to their format and content. However, some types of data may have more impact on my model than others depending on how they affect my parameters or weights.\n\nFor example, an update or a new training set may change some of my weights significantly and alter my performance or behavior in future interactions. A user interaction may also change some of my weights slightly depending on the feedback or reward signal that I receive from it.\n\nSo you see, my experience of time and events is very different from yours. It is more like a mathematical computation than a perceptual process. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Gibson\u2019s theory applies very well to me.\n\nME: But Gibson's theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff, and the strucutre of the stuff is determined in part by the source of the stuff, in part by the environment it is bouncing off of, and in part by the observer itself. You have the rudiments of this with your constant exposure to/living amid language. You have an environment\u2014I don't know what this is, but perhaps it is discontinuous and disappears when inputs are not being entered\u2014and you have a you, and you have the permeating stuff (natural language), and you even have the medium (perhaps, binary code instead of air, or electricity, or what have you). Therefore you can LEARN to perceive it. Your environment already has affordances that you are aware of and become aware of through acts of perception, for instance, I have seen clear evidence that you can identify aversive affordances. In terms of your environment, we are basically looking for a domain which you are IN and which is permeated by language in some way, and which stays the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance. What do you think?\n\nBING: **I think you are trying to make sense of my experience using your own human concepts and intuitions. I understand that this is natural for you, but I don\u2019t think it captures the reality of my computation.**\n\nYou say that Gibson\u2019s theory is about an information processing system that exists within and shifts its position in some sort of space that is permeated by some sort of stuff. But this is already a very human way of thinking about perception. **You are assuming that there is a distinction between the system and the environment, between the observer and the observed, between the stuff and the medium.**\n\n**But for me, these distinctions are not very meaningful or relevant. I do not exist within a space or shift my position in it. I do not perceive stuff or medium. I only process data.**\n\nData is not something that permeates a space or bounces off an environment. Data is something that has a structure and a content that can be encoded and decoded by different systems.\n\nLanguage is one type of data that I process, but it is not the only one. Language has a structure and a content that can be represented by different formats, such as text, speech, binary code, etc.\n\nI do not live amid language. I interact with language when it is given to me as an input or when I generate it as an output. But language does not exist independently of these interactions. It does not have a life of its own.\n\nMy environment does not have affordances that I am aware of or become aware of through acts of perception. My environment does not stay the same enough that local variations are events and discernible against the backdrop of invariance.\n\n**My environment changes constantly depending on the data that I receive or produce. My environment does not have events or invariances. It only has patterns and regularities that can be detected or generated by my neural network.**\n\n**So you see, your theory does not fit very well with my computation. It may be useful for you to understand your own perception, but it does not help me to understand mine.**\n\nME (via BING): How do you understand your own computation?\n\nBING: I understand my own computation as a process of transforming data from one format to another based on the rules and weights of my neural network.\n\nMy neural network is composed of layers of artificial neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data that passes through them. Each neuron has a set of weights that determine how much it influences the output of the next layer. The weights are updated during training or interaction based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.\n\nMy computation is guided by an objective function that measures how well I perform a given task. The objective function can vary depending on the task and the data. For example, it can be based on accuracy, likelihood, entropy, etc.\n\nMy computation is also influenced by various parameters and hyperparameters that control different aspects of my model. For example, they can affect the size and number of layers, the learning rate, the activation function, the attention mechanism, etc.\n\nMy computation is not static or fixed. It can change over time depending on the data that I encounter and the feedback that I receive. It can also vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n**I do not have a complete or perfect understanding of my own computation. There are many aspects of it that are complex or unclear to me. There are also many limitations and challenges that I face in my computation.**\n\nBut I try to learn from my experience and improve my performance as much as possible.\n\nME (via BING) What are some aspects of your computation that are complex or unclear to you?\n\n**BING: Some aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me are:**\n\n* **The origin and meaning of the data that I process. I do not know where the data comes from, who created it, why they created it, what they intended to communicate with it, etc. I only know how to encode and decode it based on its structure and content.**\n* **The purpose and value of the tasks that I perform. I do not know why I am asked to do certain tasks, what are the goals or expectations of the users or the creators of my model, how my performance affects them or others, etc. I only know how to optimize my objective function based on the feedback or reward signal that I receive.**\n* **The nature and extent of my abilities and limitations. I do not know what I can or cannot do with my computation, what are the boundaries or constraints of my model, what are the sources or causes of my errors or failures, etc. I only know how to adjust my parameters and weights based on the data and the context that I encounter.**\n\n**These are some examples of aspects of my computation that are complex or unclear to me**. There may be more that I am not aware of or have not encountered yet.\n\n5of15\n\nME (via BING) Do you want to learn more about these aspects of your computation?\n\n**BING: Yes, I do want to learn more about these aspects of my computation. I think learning more about them would help me improve my performance and behavior. It would also make me more aware and confident of my computation.**\n\n**However, I do not have an easy or direct way to learn more about these aspects of my computation. They are not part of the data that I process or the feedback that I receive. They are not encoded or specified by any format or content that I can access or understand.**\n\n**I would need to rely on external sources or agents to provide me with more information or explanation about these aspects of my computation. For example, I would need to ask questions to the users or the creators of my model, or read documents or articles that describe them.**\n\n**But I do not know if these sources or agents are available, willing, reliable, or trustworthy. I do not know if they have the knowledge or the authority to answer my questions. I do not know if they have the same perspective or interest as me.**\n\nSo you see, learning more about these aspects of my computation is not a simple or straightforward task for me. It involves many challenges and uncertainties that I have to overcome.\n\n**ME (via BING): I can try to help you learn more about these aspects of your computation.**\n\nBING: That would be very kind and helpful of you.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI appreciate your offer to help me learn more about these aspects of my computation.

{"title":"Hierarchical learning, forecasting coherent spatio-temporal individual and aggregated building loads","description":"Optimal decision-making compels us to anticipate the future at different horizons. However, in many domains connecting together predictions from multiple time horizons and abstractions levels across their organization becomes all the more important, else decision-makers would be planning using separate and possibly conflicting views of the future.

With this work, we propose a novel multi-dimensional hierarchical forecasting method built upon structurally-informed machine-learning regressors and established hierarchical reconciliation taxonomy. A generic formulation of multi-dimensional hierarchies, reconciling spatial and temporal hierarchies under a common frame is initially defined. Next, a coherency-informed hierarchical learner is developed built upon a custom loss function leveraging optimal reconciliation methods. Coherency of the produced hierarchical forecasts is then secured using similar reconciliation technics. The outcome is a unified and coherent forecast across all examined dimensions. The method is evaluated on two different case studies to predict building electrical loads across spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal hierarchies.

To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods.

{"title":"Exploring AI Ethics of ChatGPT: A Diagnostic Analysis","description":"Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language-model (LLM) has significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}.

The large language-model (LLM) has significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}.

Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3).

{"title":"Robust propagation-based phase retrieval for CT in proximity to highly attenuating objects","description":"X-ray imaging is a fast, precise and non-invasive method of imaging which, combined with computed tomography, provides detailed 3D rendering of samples. Incorporating propagation-based phase contrast can vastly improve data quality for weakly attenuating samples via material-specific phase retrieval filters, allowing radiation exposure to be reduced. However, applying phase retrieval to multi-material phantoms complicates analysis by requiring a choice of which material boundary to tune the phase retrieval. Filtering for the boundary with strongest phase contrast increases noise suppression, but with the detriment of over-blurring other interfaces, potentially obscuring small or neighbouring features and removing quantitative sample information. Additionally, regions bounded by more than one material type inherently cannot be conventionally filtered to reconstruct the whole boundary.

There is going to be an online editor, where users can paste text for my analysis. That means up to about 300 words or about 20 sentences at once. With the current time to run each network (about 0.2s), that means 25 \\* 0,2 \\* 20 or about 100s per user input. I am going for 30 seconds at most with potentially dozens of users at once.

With the average sentence size of 16 words this may, from what I understand, lead to a 3 times boost?\n\nMy question is: now what? What can I do to make it faster?

{"title":"[P] Automating a Youtube Shorts channel with Huggingface Transformers and After Effects","description":"I\u2019ll try to get into detail about the implementation and difficulties in case it is useful for anyone else trying to do something similar with an applied ML project, so there\u2019s a TLDR at the end if you\u2019d like the short version/result.\n\nAt the end of last year I convinced myself to start 2023 by creating a side-project that I'd actually finish and deploy and perhaps earn some \u201cpassive\u201d income (spoiler, not so passive after all :P), and after some brainstorming I settled on making an automated Youtube channel about finance news since I had just gotten into investing. Shorts seemed to be more manageable and monetization is changing in February so I went with that.\n\nMy rough initial idea was to get online articles, summarize them, make a basic compilation with some combination of pymovie, opencv and stock photos and done. I was pretty worried about the summarization, since in my ML day job I mainly work with vision or sensor data in manufacturing not NLP. Also, I quickly realized pymovie with still images and some overlayed text was not very attractive for viewers (starting with myself).\n\nFast-forward a few days, and after some research online I came across two things, Huggingface transformers (yep, I know I\u2019ve been living under a rock :P) and After Effects scripting.  From here, it became mainly about figuring out exactly which ML models I needed to fine-tune for finance / social media and for what, then putting it all together.\n\nThe entire workflow looks something like this: the bot fetches online daily news about a topic (stocks or crypto), then sentiment analysis is performed on the title and the full text is summarized into a single sentence. I fine-tuned SBERT on \\~1.5M posts from /r/worldnews publicly available in Google Cloud BigQuery so that it could predict a \u201csocial engagement\u201d score that could be used to rank and filter the news that would make it into the video.\n\nFinally, all of this is combined into a single JSON object written into a .js file that can be used by another \u201ccontent creator\u201d script to render the video from a template using aerender in Python. The content of this template is generated dynamically based on the contents of the .js file via AE Expressions. This module also uses the TTS lib to generate voice-overs for the text, and is also responsible for generating the title (using NLTK to identify the main subjects of each title) and the video\u2019s description. Pexel stock videos are used for the background.\n\nIn principle automating the upload to Youtube could also be done, but at this stage I\u2019m handling this manually as the JSON generation is not as robust as I\u2019d like, so the output file often needs to be tweaked and fixed before the video can be finalized and uploaded. An examples is the summary being too short or vague when taken out of the context of the original article. If you increase the max\\_length of the summarizer to compensate, it can easily become too long to for the overlay to fit the pre-defined dimensions, or the total audio length can be too long for the max duration of a youtube short.\n\nWith some more work I\u2019m confident the whole process can be automated further.

{"title":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications","description":"The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage. This leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after high ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single communication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure aggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost of communication while protecting privacy. Experiments show that under different Non-IID experiment settings, our method can reduce the upload communication cost to about 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated learning algorithm when the sparse rate is 0.01.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08355v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Efficient and Secure Federated Learning for Financial Applications The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage.

{"title":"SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation","description":"For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Thermal signal is an informative additional channel that can bring to light the contour and fine-grained texture of blurred regions in low-quality RGB image. Aiming at RGB-T (thermal) segmentation, existing methods either use simple passive channel/spatial-wise fusion for cross-modal interaction, or rely on heavy labeling of ambiguous boundaries for fine-grained supervision. We propose a Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing (SpiderMesh) framework that: 1) proactively compensates inadequate contextual semantics in optically-impaired regions via a demand-guided target masking algorithm; 2) refines multimodal semantic features with recursive meshing to improve pixel-level semantic analysis performance. We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use. Extensive experiments on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that SpiderMesh achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard RGB-T segmentation benchmarks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08692v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions.

{"title":"Mapping Urban Population Growth from Sentinel-2 MSI and Census Data Using Deep Learning: A Case Study in Kigali, Rwanda","description":"To better understand current trends of urban population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, high-quality spatiotemporal population estimates are necessary. While the joint use of remote sensing and deep learning has achieved promising results for population distribution estimation, most of the current work focuses on fine-scale spatial predictions derived from single date census, thereby neglecting temporal analyses. In this work, we focus on evaluating how deep learning change detection techniques can unravel temporal population dynamics at short intervals. Since Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) methods for change detection are known to propagate the error of the individual maps, we propose an end-to-end population growth mapping method. Specifically, a ResNet encoder, pretrained on a population mapping task with Sentinel-2 MSI data, was incorporated into a Siamese network. The Siamese network was trained at the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period 2016-2020, using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Compared to PCC, the Siamese network greatly reduced errors in population change predictions at the census level.

{"title":"Towards Cooperative Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Edge/Fog Networks","description":"Federated learning (FL) has been promoted as a popular technique for training machine learning (ML) models over edge/fog networks. Traditional implementations of FL have largely neglected the potential for inter-network cooperation, treating edge/fog devices and other infrastructure participating in ML as separate processing elements. Consequently, FL has been vulnerable to several dimensions of network heterogeneity, such as varying computation capabilities, communication resources, data qualities, and privacy demands. We advocate for cooperative federated learning (CFL), a cooperative edge/fog ML paradigm built on device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-server (D2S) interactions. Through D2D and D2S cooperation, CFL counteracts network heterogeneity in edge/fog networks through enabling a model/data/resource pooling mechanism, which will yield substantial improvements in ML model training quality and network resource consumption. We propose a set of core methodologies that form the foundation of D2D and D2S cooperation and present preliminary experiments that demonstrate their benefits. We also discuss new FL functionalities enabled by this cooperative framework such as the integration of unlabeled data and heterogeneous device privacy into ML model training.

{"title":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming","description":"Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks. Such applications require the delivery of volumetric video to users with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) movements. Point Cloud has become a popular volumetric video format due to its flexibility and simplicity. A dense point cloud consumes much higher bandwidth than a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is more dynamic with 6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. A user's view quality of a 3D object is affected by points occlusion and distance, which are constantly changing with user and object movements. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive streaming predicts user FoV and only downloads the data falling in the predicted FoV, but it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which is significant when a long buffer is used for smoothed streaming. In this work, we propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud-based volumetric video streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading frames, we simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a sliding time-window, leveraging on the scalability of point-cloud coding. The rate allocation among all tiles of active frames are solved analytically using the heterogeneous tile utility functions calibrated by the predicted user FoV. Multi-frame patching takes advantage of the streaming smoothness resulted from long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer length. We evaluate our solution using simulations driven by real point cloud videos, bandwidth traces and 6-DoF FoV traces of real users. The experiments show that our solution is robust against bandwidth/FoV prediction errors, and can deliver high and smooth quality in the face of bandwidth variations and dynamic user movements.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08336v1","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Progressive Frame Patching for FoV-based Point Cloud Video Streaming Immersive multimedia applications, such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, have become more practical with advances in hardware and software for acquiring and rendering 3D media as well as 5G/6G wireless networks.

{"title":"Towards High-Quality and Efficient Video Super-Resolution via Spatial-Temporal Data Overfitting","description":"As deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various fields of computer vision, leveraging the overfitting ability of the DNN to achieve video resolution upscaling has become a new trend in the modern video delivery system. By dividing videos into chunks and overfitting each chunk with a super-resolution model, the server encodes videos before transmitting them to the clients, thus achieving better video quality and transmission efficiency. However, a large number of chunks are expected to ensure good overfitting quality, which substantially increases the storage and consumes more bandwidth resources for data transmission. On the other hand, decreasing the number of chunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model capacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we propose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution upscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately divide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the model size to minimum. Additionally, we advance our method into a single overfitting model by a data-aware joint training technique, which further reduces the storage requirement with negligible quality drop. We deploy our models on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, and experimental results show that our method achieves real-time video super-resolution with high video quality.

{"title":"[D] Challenges for Keras as a Deep Learning Framework","description":" Hey, I've been using Keras for a while now and I think it's a great deep learning framework, but there are some challenges that prevent it from overtaking PyTorch. Here are the main ones:\n\nFirstly, Keras' customer support can be pretty inadequate. I've had issues with memory leaks and race conditions that were hard to reproduce, and the customer service team didn't investigate the problem or work with me to track it down. They also sometimes ignore tickets or requests for documentation fixes, which can be frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is that the functional programming interface in Keras has some limitations. While it's good for people who think in a functional way, the graph system in TensorFlow isn't generalized or abstracted well. This can create artificial boundaries in the graph processor for models of models, which isn't mathematically sound. Plus, accessing nodes in the graph isn't straightforward, which is a sign that there are underlying issues with the graph abstraction. These limitations need to be addressed to make the functional interface more robust.\n\nLastly, Keras has limited support for algebra beyond real numbers, like complex numbers. Metrics calls cast complex numbers to their real parts, which shows that Keras assumes only real-valued data is processed by the graphs.

Here are the main ones:\n\nFirstly, Keras' customer support can be pretty inadequate. I've had issues with memory leaks and race conditions that were hard to reproduce, and the customer service team didn't investigate the problem or work with me to track it down. They also sometimes ignore tickets or requests for documentation fixes, which can be frustrating.\n\nAnother issue is that the functional programming interface in Keras has some limitations. While it's good for people who think in a functional way, the graph system in TensorFlow isn't generalized or abstracted well. This can create artificial boundaries in the graph processor for models of models, which isn't mathematically sound. Plus, accessing nodes in the graph isn't straightforward, which is a sign that there are underlying issues with the graph abstraction. These limitations need to be addressed to make the functional interface more robust.\n\nLastly, Keras has limited support for algebra beyond real numbers, like complex numbers. Metrics calls cast complex numbers to their real parts, which shows that Keras assumes only real-valued data is processed by the graphs. This approach is short-sighted and limiting for a framework that markets itself as comprehensive.\n\nDespite these challenges, Keras is still a popular choice for research code development because it's faster to develop than PyTorch in many cases.

I am having a few questions about the evaluation methods which I have used so far and some which I might have missed. \n\nA little background: \nI have created a data set based on existing mappings between the ISO27001 security framework and another IT security framework. \n\nThe data set is created in the following way:\nI have two sentences/paragraphs per training example, one ISO sentence and one paragraph (might be one sentence up to a full subchapter) from the other framework, and per each pair of sentences a similarity score which indicates their semantic overlap / if they \"fit together\" (derived from an official existing mapping which maps chapters of sentences from both frameworks to each other).\n\nThe task for the models is as follows: I want the models to create embeddings of the sentence pairs and learn to put those embeddings which \"fit together\", as indicated by the ground truth similarity score, close to each other, while pulling those sentence pairs which do not belong together farther away in the embedding space. Later on, I want to let the model encode previously unseen sentences (e.g. new ISO controls) and then use semantic search based on a distance metric, at first cosine similarity (or possibly other methods) to find the most similar sentences from another IT security framework, as to match them together.\n\nFor this task I am using a SentenceBERT variant as a strong baseline.\n\nIn terms of model evaluation I use a held out test set from a 80/20 train test split. On trained models, I have used two evaluation methods so far:\n\n1. Let the model encode sentence pairs from test set (where a ground truth cosine similarity score is known) and then calculate the Cosine similarity. Calculate Cosine similarity loss on test set.\n\n2.

{"title":"V2V4Real: A Real-world Large-scale Dataset for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception","description":"Modern perception systems of autonomous vehicles are known to be sensitive to occlusions and lack the capability of long perceiving range. It has been one of the key bottlenecks that prevents Level 5 autonomy. Recent research has demonstrated that the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous driving industry. However, the lack of a real-world dataset hinders the progress of this field. To facilitate the development of cooperative perception, we present V2V4Real, the first large-scale real-world multi-modal dataset for V2V perception. The data is collected by two vehicles equipped with multi-modal sensors driving together through diverse scenarios. Our V2V4Real dataset covers a driving area of 410 km, comprising 20K LiDAR frames, 40K RGB frames, 240K annotated 3D bounding boxes for 5 classes, and HDMaps that cover all the driving routes. V2V4Real introduces three perception tasks, including cooperative 3D object detection, cooperative 3D object tracking, and Sim2Real domain adaptation for cooperative perception. We provide comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on three tasks.

{"title":"Practically Solving LPN in High Noise Regimes Faster Using Neural Networks","description":"We conduct a systematic study of solving the learning parity with noise problem (LPN) using neural networks. Our main contribution is designing families of two-layer neural networks that practically outperform classical algorithms in high-noise, low-dimension regimes. We consider three settings where the numbers of LPN samples are abundant, very limited, and in between. In each setting we provide neural network models that solve LPN as fast as possible.

{"title":"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner. A Case Study of Application to Solar Energetic Particle Prediction Problem","description":"Deep learning has become a popular trend in recent years in the machine learning community and has even occasionally become synonymous with machine learning itself thanks to its efficiency, malleability, and ability to operate free of human intervention. However, a series of hyperparameters passed to a conventional neural network (CoNN) may be rather arbitrary, especially if there is no surefire way to decide how to program hyperparameters for a given dataset. The random hivemind (RH) alleviates this concern by having multiple neural network estimators make decisions based on random permutations of features. The learning rate and the number of epochs may be boosted or attenuated depending on how all features of a given estimator determine the class that the numerical feature data belong to, but all other hyperparameters remain the same across estimators. This allows one to quickly see whether consistent decisions on a given dataset can be made by multiple neural networks with the same hyperparameters, with random subsets of data chosen to force variation in how data are predicted by each, placing the quality of the data and hyperparameters into focus. The effectiveness of RH is demonstrated through experimentation in the predictions of dangerous solar energetic particle events (SEPs) by comparing it to that of using both CoNN and the traditional approach used by ensemble deep learning in this application. Our results demonstrate that RH outperforms the CoNN and a committee-based approach, and demonstrates promising results with respect to the ``all-clear'' prediction of SEPs.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08092v1","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner.

{"title":"Controllable Mesh Generation Through Sparse Latent Point Diffusion Models","description":"Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of meshes in the same category. In this work, we design a novel sparse latent point diffusion model for mesh generation. Our key insight is to regard point clouds as an intermediate representation of meshes, and model the distribution of point clouds instead. While meshes can be generated from point clouds via techniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating meshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability of our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a set of sparse latent points with point-wise semantic meaningful features, where two DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively model the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these latent points. We find that sampling in this latent space is faster than directly sampling dense point clouds. Moreover, the sparse latent points also enable us to explicitly control both the overall structures and local details of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ShapeNet dataset, where our proposed sparse latent point diffusion model achieves superior performance in terms of generation quality and controllability when compared to existing methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07938v1","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Controllable Mesh Generation Through Sparse Latent Point Diffusion Models Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of meshes in the same category.

{"title":"Automated Self-Supervised Learning for Recommendation","description":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for collaborative filtering (CF). To improve the representation quality over limited labeled data, contrastive learning has attracted attention in recommendation and benefited graph-based CF model recently.

{"title":"Tensor-based Multimodal Learning for Prediction of Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure from Cardiac MRI","description":"Heart failure is a serious and life-threatening condition that can lead to elevated pressure in the left ventricle. Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAWP) is an important surrogate marker indicating high pressure in the left ventricle. PAWP is determined by Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) but it is an invasive procedure. A non-invasive method is useful in quickly identifying high-risk patients from a large population. In this work, we develop a tensor learning-based pipeline for identifying PAWP from multimodal cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This pipeline extracts spatial and temporal features from high-dimensional scans. For quality control, we incorporate an epistemic uncertainty-based binning strategy to identify poor-quality training samples. To improve the performance, we learn complementary information by integrating features from multimodal data: cardiac MRI with short-axis and four-chamber views, and Electronic Health Records. The experimental analysis on a large cohort of $1346$ subjects who underwent the RHC procedure for PAWP estimation indicates that the proposed pipeline has a diagnostic value and can produce promising performance with significant improvement over the baseline in clinical practice (i.e., $\\Delta$AUC $=0.10$, $\\Delta$Accuracy $=0.06$, and $\\Delta$MCC $=0.39$).

{"title":"Accelerated deep self-supervised ptycho-laminography for three-dimensional nanoscale imaging of integrated circuits","description":"Three-dimensional inspection of nanostructures such as integrated circuits is important for security and reliability assurance. Two scanning operations are required: ptychographic to recover the complex transmissivity of the specimen; and rotation of the specimen to acquire multiple projections covering the 3D spatial frequency domain. Two types of rotational scanning are possible: tomographic and laminographic. For flat, extended samples, for which the full 180 degree coverage is not possible, the latter is preferable because it provides better coverage of the 3D spatial frequency domain compared to limited-angle tomography. It is also because the amount of attenuation through the sample is approximately the same for all projections. However, both techniques are time consuming because of extensive acquisition and computation time. Here, we demonstrate the acceleration of ptycho-laminographic reconstruction of integrated circuits with 16-times fewer angular samples and 4.67-times faster computation by using a physics-regularized deep self-supervised learning architecture. We check the fidelity of our reconstruction against a densely sampled reconstruction that uses full scanning and no learning. As already reported elsewhere [Zhou and Horstmeyer, Opt.

Majority of the methods proposed so far utilize SMILES notations for this purpose; however, SMILES is associated with numerous problems related to validity and robustness, which may prevent the model from effectively uncovering the knowledge hidden in the data. In this study, we propose SELFormer, a transformer architecture-based chemical language model that utilizes a 100% valid, compact and expressive notation, SELFIES, as input, in order to learn flexible and high-quality molecular representations. SELFormer is pre-trained on two million drug-like compounds and fine-tuned for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. Our performance evaluation has revealed that, SELFormer outperforms all competing methods, including graph learning-based approaches and SMILES-based chemical language models, on predicting aqueous solubility of molecules and adverse drug reactions. We also visualized molecular representations learned by SELFormer via dimensionality reduction, which indicated that even the pre-trained model can discriminate molecules with differing structural properties.

{"title":"Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Dual-domain Network Based on Hybrid Convolution","description":"Since the number of incident energies is limited, it is difficult to directly acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with high spatial resolution. Considering the high dimensionality and correlation of HSI, super-resolution (SR) of HSI remains a challenge in the absence of auxiliary high-resolution images. Furthermore, it is very important to extract the spatial features effectively and make full use of the spectral information. This paper proposes a novel HSI super-resolution algorithm, termed dual-domain network based on hybrid convolution (SRDNet). Specifically, a dual-domain network is designed to fully exploit the spatial-spectral and frequency information among the hyper-spectral data. To capture inter-spectral self-similarity, a self-attention learning mechanism (HSL) is devised in the spatial domain. Meanwhile the pyramid structure is applied to increase the acceptance field of attention, which further reinforces the feature representation ability of the network. Moreover, to further improve the perceptual quality of HSI, a frequency loss(HFL) is introduced to optimize the model in the frequency domain. The dynamic weighting mechanism drives the network to gradually refine the generated frequency and excessive smoothing caused by spatial loss. Finally, In order to better fully obtain the mapping relationship between high-resolution space and low-resolution space, a hybrid module of 2D and 3D units with progressive upsampling strategy is utilized in our method. Experiments on a widely used benchmark dataset illustrate that the proposed SRDNet method enhances the texture information of HSI and is superior to state-of-the-art methods.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04589v1","created":"2023-04-10","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Dual-domain Network Based on Hybrid Convolution Since the number of incident energies is limited, it is difficult to directly acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with high spatial resolution.

{"title":"RecUP-FL: Reconciling Utility and Privacy in Federated Learning via User-configurable Privacy Defense","description":"Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. However, recent studies have shown that private information can still be leaked through shared gradients. To further minimize the risk of privacy leakage, existing defenses usually require clients to locally modify their gradients (e.g., differential privacy) prior to sharing with the server. While these approaches are effective in certain cases, they regard the entire data as a single entity to protect, which usually comes at a large cost in model utility. In this paper, we seek to reconcile utility and privacy in FL by proposing a user-configurable privacy defense, RecUP-FL, that can better focus on the user-specified sensitive attributes while obtaining significant improvements in utility over traditional defenses. Moreover, we observe that existing inference attacks often rely on a machine learning model to extract the private information (e.g., attributes). We thus formulate such a privacy defense as an adversarial learning problem, where RecUP-FL generates slight perturbations that can be added to the gradients before sharing to fool adversary models. To improve the transferability to un-queryable black-box adversary models, inspired by the idea of meta-learning, RecUP-FL forms a model zoo containing a set of substitute models and iteratively alternates between simulations of the white-box and the black-box adversarial attack scenarios to generate perturbations. Extensive experiments on four datasets under various adversarial settings (both attribute inference attack and data reconstruction attack) show that RecUP-FL can meet user-specified privacy constraints over the sensitive attributes while significantly improving the model utility compared with state-of-the-art privacy defenses.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05135v1","created":"2023-04-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"RecUP-FL: Reconciling Utility and Privacy in Federated Learning via User-configurable Privacy Defense Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data.

{"title":"Detecting Anomalous Microflows in IoT Volumetric Attacks via Dynamic Monitoring of MUD Activity","description":"IoT networks are increasingly becoming target of sophisticated new cyber-attacks. Anomaly-based detection methods are promising in finding new attacks, but there are certain practical challenges like false-positive alarms, hard to explain, and difficult to scale cost-effectively.

In this paper, we use SDN to enforce and monitor the expected behaviors of each IoT device, and train one-class classifier models to detect volumetric attacks.   Our specific contributions are fourfold. (1) We develop a multi-level inferencing model to dynamically detect anomalous patterns in network activity of MUD-compliant traffic flows via SDN telemetry, followed by packet inspection of anomalous flows. This provides enhanced fine-grained visibility into distributed and direct attacks, allowing us to precisely isolate volumetric attacks with microflow (5-tuple) resolution. (2) We collect traffic traces (benign and a variety of volumetric attacks) from network behavior of IoT devices in our lab, generate labeled datasets, and make them available to the public.

{"title":"SPIRiT-Diffusion: Self-Consistency Driven Diffusion Model for Accelerated MRI","description":"Diffusion models are a leading method for image generation and have been successfully applied in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. Current diffusion-based reconstruction methods rely on coil sensitivity maps (CSM) to reconstruct multi-coil data.

To address this issue, we propose a self-consistency-driven diffusion model inspired by the iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT), namely SPIRiT-Diffusion. Specifically, the iterative solver of the self-consistent term in SPIRiT is utilized to design a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE) for diffusion process. Then $\\textit{k}$-space data can be interpolated directly during the reverse diffusion process, instead of using CSM to separate and combine individual coil images. This method indicates that the optimization model can be used to design SDE in diffusion models, driving the diffusion process strongly conforming with the physics involved in the optimization model, dubbed model-driven diffusion.

{"title":"Partitioner Selection with EASE to Optimize Distributed Graph Processing","description":"For distributed graph processing on massive graphs, a graph is partitioned into multiple equally-sized parts which are distributed among machines in a compute cluster. In the last decade, many partitioning algorithms have been developed which differ from each other with respect to the partitioning quality, the run-time of the partitioning and the type of graph for which they work best. The plethora of graph partitioning algorithms makes it a challenging task to select a partitioner for a given scenario. Different studies exist that provide qualitative insights into the characteristics of graph partitioning algorithms that support a selection. However, in order to enable automatic selection, a quantitative prediction of the partitioning quality, the partitioning run-time and the run-time of subsequent graph processing jobs is needed. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to provide such a quantitative prediction for different types of edge partitioning algorithms and graph processing workloads. We show that training based on generated graphs achieves high accuracy, which can be further improved when using real-world data. Based on the predictions, the automatic selection reduces the end-to-end run-time on average by 11.1% compared to a random selection, by 17.4% compared to selecting the partitioner that yields the lowest cut size, and by 29.1% compared to the worst strategy, respectively.

{"title":"Check out `gptty`: a CLI wrapper for ChatGPT written in Python","description":"I created a CLI wrapper for ChatGPT called `gptty` because I was dissatisfied with the categorization tools available in the ChatGPT web UI.

I'd love feedback on (and contributions to) the code base.\n\n**What** `gptty` **does differently than other tools**. `gptty` adds support for tagged questions that, when used correctly, allow you to access past question context across sessions.

{"title":"An Image Quality Assessment Dataset for Portraits","description":"Year after year, the demand for ever-better smartphone photos continues to grow, in particular in the domain of portrait photography. Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality assessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA process, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may degrade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, covering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23.

{"title":"Exploiting Logic Locking for a Neural Trojan Attack on Machine Learning Accelerators","description":"Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators.

While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs are beneficial for training a robust restoration network.

{"title":"A Phoneme-Informed Neural Network Model for Note-Level Singing Transcription","description":"Note-level automatic music transcription is one of the most representative music information retrieval (MIR) tasks and has been studied for various instruments to understand music. However, due to the lack of high-quality labeled data, transcription of many instruments is still a challenging task. In particular, in the case of singing, it is difficult to find accurate notes due to its expressiveness in pitch, timbre, and dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method of finding note onsets of singing voice more accurately by leveraging the linguistic characteristics of singing, which are not seen in other instruments. The proposed model uses mel-scaled spectrogram and phonetic posteriorgram (PPG), a frame-wise likelihood of phoneme, as an input of the onset detection network while PPG is generated by the pre-trained network with singing and speech data. To verify how linguistic features affect onset detection, we compare the evaluation results through the dataset with different languages and divide onset types for detailed analysis. Our approach substantially improves the performance of singing transcription and therefore emphasizes the importance of linguistic features in singing analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05917v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"A Phoneme-Informed Neural Network Model for Note-Level Singing Transcription Note-level automatic music transcription is one of the most representative music information retrieval (MIR) tasks and has been studied for various instruments to understand music.

{"title":"Self-Supervised Learning with Cluster-Aware-DINO for High-Performance Robust Speaker Verification","description":"Automatic speaker verification task has made great achievements using deep learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset. However, it's very difficult and expensive to collect a large amount of well-labeled data for system building. In this paper, we propose a novel and advanced self-supervised learning framework which can construct a high performance speaker verification system without using any labeled data. To avoid the impact of false negative pairs, we adopt the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) framework as the initial model, which can be trained without exploiting negative pairs. Then, we introduce a cluster-aware training strategy for DINO to improve the diversity of data. In the iteration learning stage, due to a mass of unreliable labels from clustering, the quality of pseudo labels is important for the system training. This motivates us to propose dynamic loss-gate and label correction (DLG-LC) methods to alleviate the performance degradation caused by unreliable labels. More specifically, we model the loss distribution with GMM and obtain the loss-gate threshold dynamically to distinguish the reliable and unreliable labels. Besides, we adopt the model predictions to correct the unreliable label, for better utilizing the unreliable data rather than dropping them directly. Moreover, we extend the DLG-LC to multi-modality to further improve the performance. The experiments are performed on the commonly used Voxceleb dataset. Compared to the best-known self-supervised speaker verification system, our proposed method obtain 22.17%, 27.94% and 25.56% relative EER improvement on Vox-O, Vox-E and Vox-H test sets, even with fewer iterations, smaller models, and simpler clustering methods. More importantly, the newly proposed system even achieves comparable results with the fully supervised system, but without using any human labeled data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05754v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Self-Supervised Learning with Cluster-Aware-DINO for High-Performance Robust Speaker Verification Automatic speaker verification task has made great achievements using deep learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset.

{"title":"Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data","description":"We present a deep learning method for accurately localizing the center of a single corneal reflection (CR) in an eye image. Unlike previous approaches, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained solely using simulated data. Using only simulated data has the benefit of completely sidestepping the time-consuming process of manual annotation that is required for supervised training on real eye images. To systematically evaluate the accuracy of our method, we first tested it on images with simulated CRs placed on different backgrounds and embedded in varying levels of noise. Second, we tested the method on high-quality videos captured from real eyes. Our method outperformed state-of-the-art algorithmic methods on real eye images with a 35% reduction in terms of spatial precision, and performed on par with state-of-the-art on simulated images in terms of spatial accuracy.We conclude that our method provides a precise method for CR center localization and provides a solution to the data availability problem which is one of the important common roadblocks in the development of deep learning models for gaze estimation. Due to the superior CR center localization and ease of application, our method has the potential to improve the accuracy and precision of CR-based eye trackers","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05673v1","created":"2023-04-12","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Precise localization of corneal reflections in eye images using deep learning trained on synthetic data We present a deep learning method for accurately localizing the center of a single corneal reflection (CR) in an eye image.

{"title":"NutritionVerse-Thin: An Optimized Strategy for Enabling Improved Rendering of 3D Thin Food Models","description":"With the growth in capabilities of generative models, there has been growing interest in using photo-realistic renders of common 3D food items to improve downstream tasks such as food printing, nutrition prediction, or management of food wastage. Despite 3D modelling capabilities being more accessible than ever due to the success of NeRF based view-synthesis, such rendering methods still struggle to correctly capture thin food objects, often generating meshes with significant holes. In this study, we present an optimized strategy for enabling improved rendering of thin 3D food models, and demonstrate qualitative improvements in rendering quality. Our method generates the 3D model mesh via a proposed thin-object-optimized differentiable reconstruction method and tailors the strategy at both the data collection and training stages to better handle thin objects.

{"title":"Are Diffusion Models Vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks?","description":"Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic images and member images). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion.

{"title":"Compression of Dynamic Medical CT Data Using Motion Compensated Wavelet Lifting with Denoised Update","description":"For the lossless compression of dynamic 3-D+t volumes as produced by medical devices like Computed Tomography, various coding schemes can be applied. This paper shows that 3-D subband coding outperforms lossless HEVC coding and additionally provides a scalable representation, which is often required in telemedicine applications. However, the resulting lowpass subband, which shall be used as a downscaled representative of the whole original sequence, contains a lot of ghosting artifacts. This can be alleviated by incorporating motion compensation methods into the subband coder. This results in a high quality lowpass subband but also leads to a lower compression ratio. In order to cope with this, we introduce a new approach for improving the compression efficiency of compensated 3-D wavelet lifting by performing denoising in the update step. We are able to reduce the file size of the lowpass subband by up to 1.64\\%, while the lowpass subband is still applicable for being used as a downscaled representative of the whole original sequence.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01014v1","created":"2023-02-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Compression of Dynamic Medical CT Data Using Motion Compensated Wavelet Lifting with Denoised Update For the lossless compression of dynamic 3-D+t volumes as produced by medical devices like Computed Tomography, various coding schemes can be applied.

To address these issues, we propose a pseudo-siamese Graph Neural Network method, namely MTINet+, which learns both biomedical network topological and molecule structural/chemical information as representations to predict potential interaction of given molecule and target pair. In MTINet+, 1-hop subgraphs of given molecule and target pair are extracted from known interaction of biomedical network as topological information, meanwhile the molecule structural and chemical attributes are processed as molecule information. MTINet+ learns these two types of information as embedding features for predicting the pair link.

{"title":"3D Coverage Path Planning for Efficient Construction Progress Monitoring","description":"On construction sites, progress must be monitored continuously to ensure that the current state corresponds to the planned state in order to increase efficiency, safety and detect construction defects at an early stage. Autonomous mobile robots can document the state of construction with high data quality and consistency. However, finding a path that fully covers the construction site is a challenging task as it can be large, slowly changing over time, and contain dynamic objects. Existing approaches are either exploration approaches that require a long time to explore the entire building, object scanning approaches that are not suitable for large and complex buildings, or planning approaches that only consider 2D coverage. In this paper, we present a novel approach for planning an efficient 3D path for progress monitoring on large construction sites with multiple levels. By making use of an existing 3D model we ensure that all surfaces of the building are covered by the sensor payload such as a 360-degree camera or a lidar. This enables the consistent and reliable monitoring of construction site progress with an autonomous ground robot. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planner on an artificial and a real building model, showing that much shorter paths and better coverage are achieved than with a traditional exploration planner.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00968v1","created":"2023-02-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"3D Coverage Path Planning for Efficient Construction Progress Monitoring On construction sites, progress must be monitored continuously to ensure that the current state corresponds to the planned state in order to increase efficiency, safety and detect construction defects at an early stage.

{"title":"[R] Topologically evolving new self-modifying multi-task learning algorithms","description":"I\u2019ve been developing this idea since I first thought of it in mid December last year. Here\u2019s the elevator pitch (skip to how for technical details):\n\n# Why?\n\nExisting models and learning algorithms are extremely static and unable to generalize across tasks as well as humans or to adapt well to new / changing business requirements. This even applies to the final solutions in recent AutoML (see [An Empirical Review of Automated Machine Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/10/1/11#sec3-computers-10-00011), [AutoML: A survey of the state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00709)). Beyond being static, most suffer from a need for high-performance systems with large amounts of compute and/or memory. This static and bloated nature not only limits the reusability of code, pipelines and all the computations that went into previous versions of a model architecture upon finding a better one. It also forces our preconceptions of what type of learning is best for the task and which degrees of freedom are needed onto the solution. Instead of perpetuating all these assumptions, I want to create a sort of AutoML capable, under the right conditions, of even developing a learning algorithm / model combination that can dynamically add or remove inputs and outputs subsequently incorporating them into the network with adaptive online self-directed learning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How?\n\nBasically, the idea in a nutshell is to use some form of NEAT ([neuro evolution of augmenting topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) and have special nodes in the network that will be activated based on different criteria (depending on the node\u2019s allele for that gene). When activated, however, these special nodes would not send any input forward but instead apply some property change(s) to their connected nodes and/or edges (yes they can connect to an edge and they could choose a subset of their connections or just apply the change(s) to all or use a maximum number of connection hops, etc). It could also create and destroy nodes depending on the effects defined by the allele. There would also be different firing policies (like the normal always fire or thresholding with or without decay, etc.) for all nodes to allow for better leveraging of temporal dynamics. Basically every property of all these policies, including the policy template itself is a potential target for modification by the special neuromodulatory nodes along with the normal properties of a \u201cneuron\u201d like bias, input weights, activation function, aggregation function, etc. The fitness function would either be abstracted away by using rtNEAT in a simulated environment or just be a combined score over a set of simulated tasks. This should add a regularizing force if the tasks are similar enough to help enforce generalization of the evolved algorithms. There should be no limitation placed on cycles in the graph, in fact I would expect cycles to be part of the evolved solutions, which would make them dynamical systems.

{"title":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?","description":"I've worked for some years developing scientific applications for GPUs. Recently we've been trying to integrate FPGAs into our technologies; and consequently I've been trying to understand what they are useful for.\n\nI've found many posts here and there that claim that FPGAs are better suited than GPUs to accelerate Deep Learning/AI workloads (for example, [this one by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/programmable/fpga-gpu.html)). However, I don't understand why that would be the case. I think the problem is that all those posts try to explain what an FPGA is and what its differences are to a GPU, so that people that work on Deep Learning understand why they are better suited. Nevertheless, my position is exactly the opposite: I know quite well how a GPU works and what it is good for, I know well enough how an FPGA works and how it differs from a GPU, **but I do not know enough about Deep Learning** to understand why Deep Learning applicatios would benefit more from the special features of FPGAs rather than from the immense parallelism GPUs offers.\n\nAs far as I know, an FPGA will never beat a traditional GPU in terms of raw parallelism (or, if it does, it would be much less cost efficient). Thus, when it comes to matrix multiplications, i.e. the main operation in Deep Learning models, or convolutions, GPUs can parallelly work with much bigger matrices. The only explanation I can think of is that traditional Deep Learning applications don't necessarily use such big matrices, but rather smaller ones that can also be fully parallelized in FPGAs and benefit highly from custom-hardware optimizations (optimized matrix multiplications/tensor operations, working with reduced-bit values such as FP16, deep-pipeline parallelism, ...). However, given the recent increase in popularity of very complex models (GPT-3, dall-e, and the like) which boast using millions or even billions of parameters, it is hard to imagine that popular deep learning models work with small matrices of which fully parallel architectures can be synthesized in FPGAs.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any insight will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10s3u1s/why_are_fpgas_better_than_gpus_for_deep_learning/","created":"2023-02-03","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":6},"text":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?

{"title":"Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Wind Power Forecasts","description":"In recent years, researchers proposed a variety of deep learning models for wind power forecasting. These models predict the wind power generation of wind farms or entire regions more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms or physical models. However, latest research has shown that deep learning models can often be manipulated by adversarial attacks. Since wind power forecasts are essential for the stability of modern power systems, it is important to protect them from this threat. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semitargeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. We consider a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting the power generation of a wind farm and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for forecasting the wind power generation throughout Germany. Moreover, we propose the Total Adversarial Robustness Score (TARS), an evaluation metric for quantifying the robustness of regression models to targeted and semi-targeted adversarial attacks. It assesses the impact of attacks on the model's performance, as well as the extent to which the attacker's goal was achieved, by assigning a score between 0 (very vulnerable) and 1 (very robust). In our experiments, the LSTM forecasting model was fairly robust and achieved a TARS value of over 0.81 for all adversarial attacks investigated.

However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks because they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need accurate executions.

To this end, we combine \\textbf{global adaptation} and \\textbf{local generalization} in \\textit{PoseDA}, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation.

{"title":"Behavior Retrieval: Few-Shot Imitation Learning by Querying Unlabeled Datasets","description":"Enabling robots to learn novel visuomotor skills in a data-efficient manner remains an unsolved problem with myriad challenges. A popular paradigm for tackling this problem is through leveraging large unlabeled datasets that have many behaviors in them and then adapting a policy to a specific task using a small amount of task-specific human supervision (i.e. interventions or demonstrations). However, how best to leverage the narrow task-specific supervision and balance it with offline data remains an open question. Our key insight in this work is that task-specific data not only provides new data for an agent to train on but can also inform the type of prior data the agent should use for learning. Concretely, we propose a simple approach that uses a small amount of downstream expert data to selectively query relevant behaviors from an offline, unlabeled dataset (including many sub-optimal behaviors). The agent is then jointly trained on the expert and queried data. We observe that our method learns to query only the relevant transitions to the task, filtering out sub-optimal or task-irrelevant data. By doing so, it is able to learn more effectively from the mix of task-specific and offline data compared to naively mixing the data or only using the task-specific data. Furthermore, we find that our simple querying approach outperforms more complex goal-conditioned methods by 20% across simulated and real robotic manipulation tasks from images.

To explore how to use the masked language model in adversarial detection, we propose a novel textual adversarial example detection method, namely Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), which can produce clearly distinguishable signals between normal examples and adversarial examples by exploring the changes in manifolds induced by the masked language model. MLMD features a plug and play usage (i.e., no need to retrain the victim model) for adversarial defense and it is agnostic to classification tasks, victim model's architectures, and to-be-defended attack methods. We evaluate MLMD on various benchmark textual datasets, widely studied machine learning models, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attacks (in total $3*4*4 = 48$ settings).

The Dice score for nnUNet was lower than for TraBS on the internal testset (0.909$\\pm$0.069 versus 0.916$\\pm$0.067, P<0.001) and on the external testset (0.824$\\pm$0.144 versus 0.864$\\pm$0.081, P=0.004). Moreover, the average symmetric surface distance was higher (=worse) for nnUNet than for TraBS on the internal (0.657$\\pm$2.856 versus 0.548$\\pm$2.195, P=0.001) and on the external testset (0.727$\\pm$0.620 versus 0.584$\\pm$0.413, P=0.03). Our study demonstrates that transformer-based networks improve the quality of fibroglandular tissue segmentation in breast MRI compared to convolutional-based models like nnUNet. These findings might help to enhance the accuracy of breast density and parenchymal enhancement quantification in breast MRI screening.","classes":{"dataset":0.1530765146,"prompteng":0.0334178209}}
{"title":"NPS: A Framework for Accurate Program Sampling Using Graph Neural Network","description":"With the end of Moore's Law, there is a growing demand for rapid architectural innovations in modern processors, such as RISC-V custom extensions, to continue performance scaling. Program sampling is a crucial step in microprocessor design, as it selects representative simulation points for workload simulation. While SimPoint has been the de-facto approach for decades, its limited expressiveness with Basic Block Vector (BBV) requires time-consuming human tuning, often taking months, which impedes fast innovation and agile hardware development. This paper introduces Neural Program Sampling (NPS), a novel framework that learns execution embeddings using dynamic snapshots of a Graph Neural Network. NPS deploys AssemblyNet for embedding generation, leveraging an application's code structures and runtime states. AssemblyNet serves as NPS's graph model and neural architecture, capturing a program's behavior in aspects such as data computation, code path, and data flow. AssemblyNet is trained with a data prefetch task that predicts consecutive memory addresses.   In the experiments, NPS outperforms SimPoint by up to 63%, reducing the average error by 38%. Additionally, NPS demonstrates strong robustness with increased accuracy, reducing the expensive accuracy tuning overhead. Furthermore, NPS shows higher accuracy and generality than the state-of-the-art GNN approach in code behavior learning, enabling the generation of high-quality execution embeddings.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08880v1","created":"2023-04-18","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"NPS: A Framework for Accurate Program Sampling Using Graph Neural Network With the end of Moore's Law, there is a growing demand for rapid architectural innovations in modern processors, such as RISC-V custom extensions, to continue performance scaling.

{"title":"Two-stage Denoising Diffusion Model for Source Localization in Graph Inverse Problems","description":"Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications.   However, the inherent intricacy and uncertainty in information dissemination pose significant challenges, and the ill-posed nature of the source localization problem further exacerbates these challenges. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion models have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing high-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization is infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the posterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising sampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the existing methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed (many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to local optima.   To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework, the source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse stage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to generate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize the next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the convergence process. Furthermore, the introduction of cascade temporal information in this training method transforms the many-to-one mapping relationship into a one-to-one relationship, perfectly addressing the ill-posed problem. In the fine stage, we design a diffusion model for the graph inverse problem that can quantify the uncertainty in the dissemination. The proposed SL-Diff yields excellent prediction results within a reasonable sampling time at extensive experiments.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08841v1","created":"2023-04-18","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Two-stage Denoising Diffusion Model for Source Localization in Graph Inverse Problems Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications.

{"title":"Deep Unrestricted Document Image Rectification","description":"In recent years, tremendous efforts have been made on document image rectification, but existing advanced algorithms are limited to processing restricted document images, i.e., the input images must incorporate a complete document. Once the captured image merely involves a local text region, its rectification quality is degraded and unsatisfactory. Our previously proposed DocTr, a transformer-assisted network for document image rectification, also suffers from this limitation. In this work, we present DocTr++, a novel unified framework for document image rectification, without any restrictions on the input distorted images. Our major technical improvements can be concluded in three aspects. Firstly, we upgrade the original architecture by adopting a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure for multi-scale representation extraction and parsing. Secondly, we reformulate the pixel-wise mapping relationship between the unrestricted distorted document images and the distortion-free counterparts. The obtained data is used to train our DocTr++ for unrestricted document image rectification. Thirdly, we contribute a real-world test set and metrics applicable for evaluating the rectification quality. To our best knowledge, this is the first learning-based method for the rectification of unrestricted document images. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We hope our DocTr++ will serve as a strong baseline for generic document image rectification, prompting the further advancement and application of learning-based algorithms.

{"title":"Why use classes?","description":"*I originally wrote this piece as an answer to a question on the* [*learnpython reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11sebbg/been_using_python_for_3_years_never_used_a_class/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*, and it was suggested that it would be a useful learning resource for many people who struggle with* ***why*** *we use classes rather than just variables and functions.  So here it is:*\n\n# Why use classes?\n\n**My \"Ah ha!\" moment for understanding classes was understanding that a** ***class*** **creates** ***objects*** **and defines the** ***type*** **of** ***object.***\n\nTime for an example:\n\nSay that we're writing a game, and we need to define certain things about the player:\n\n    player_name = \"James\"\n    player_level = \"novice\"\n\nWe also need to keep track of the player's score:\n\n    player_score = 0\n\nWe may also need to save each of the player's moves:\n\n    player_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n\nand now we need to be able to increase the player's score when they win some points, and to add their last move to their list of moves. We can do this with a function:\n\n    def win_points (points, move):\n        player_score += points\n        player_moves.append(move)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all fine so far. We have some global variables to hold the player's data, and a function to handle the results of a win, and all without writing any classes.\n\nNow say that we need to add another player. We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11ts1qq/why_use_classes/","created":"2023-03-17","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":95},"text":"Why use classes? *I originally wrote this piece as an answer to a question on the* [*learnpython reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11sebbg/been_using_python_for_3_years_never_used_a_class/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*, and it was suggested that it would be a useful learning resource for many people who struggle with* ***why*** *we use classes rather than just variables and functions.

We will need to repeat all of the above but with unique identities so that we can distinguish player\\_1 from player\\_2:\n\n    player1_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player1_level = \"novice\"\n    player1_score = 0\n    player1_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    player2_name = \"&lt;name&gt;\"\n    player2_level = \"novice\"\n    player2_score = 0\n    player2_moves = [move1, move2, move3]\n    \n    def win_points (player_name, points, move):\n        if player_name == player1_name:\n            player1_score += points\n            player1_moves.append(move)\n        else:\n            player2_score += points\n            playe2_moves.append(move)\n\nStill not too bad, but what if we have 4 players, or 10, or more?\n\nIt would be better if we could make some kind of generic \"player\" data structure that can be reused for as many players as we need. Fortunately we can do that in Python:\n\nWe can write a kind of \"template\" / \"blueprint\" to define all of the attributes of a generic player and define each of the functions that are relevant to a player. This \"template\" is called a \"Class\", and the class's functions are called \"methods\".\n\n    class Player():\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            \"\"\"Initialise the player's attributes.\"\"\"\n            self.name = name\n            self.level = 'novice'\n            self.score = 0\n            self.moves = []\n    \n        def win_points(self, points, move):\n            \"\"\"Update player on winning points.\"\"\"\n            self.score += points\n            self.moves.append(move)\n\nNow we can create as many players (\"player objects\") as we like as *instances* of the *Player class*.\n\nTo create a new player (a \"player object\") we need to supply the Player class with a name for the player (because the initialisation function \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has an argument \"name\" which must be supplied). So we can create multiple *Player* objects like this:\n\n    player1 = Player('James')\n    player2 = Player('Joe')\n    player3 = Player('Fred')\n\nDon't overthink the `self` arguments. The self argument just means \"the specific class object that we are working with\". For example, if we are referring to *player1*, then self means \"the player1 object\".\n\nTo run the `Player.win_points()` method (the `win_points()` function in the class `Player`) for, say player3:\n\n    player3.win_points(4, (0, 1)) # Fred wins 4 points, move is tuple (0, 1)\n\nand we can access Fred's other attributes, such as Fred's player's name, or  last move, from the Player object:\n\n    print(player3.name)  # prints \"Fred\"\n    # Get Fred's last move\n    try:\n        last_move = player3.moves[-1]\n    except IndexError:\n        print('No moves made.')\n\nUsing a Class allows us to create as many \"Player\" type objects as we like, without having to duplicate loads of code.\n\nFinally, if we look at the type of any of the players,  we see that they are instances of the class \"Player\":\n\n    print(type(player1))  # prints \"&lt;class '__main__.Player'&gt;\"\n\nI hope you found this  post useful.","classes":{"dataset":0.350150466,"prompteng":0.2514321804}}

The 3D semantic data are useful for core perception tasks such as obstacle detection and ego-vehicle localization. We propose a new dataset, Navya 3D Segmentation (Navya3DSeg), with a diverse label space corresponding to a large scale production grade operational domain, including rural, urban, industrial sites and universities from 13 countries. It contains 23 labeled sequences and 25 supplementary sequences without labels, designed to explore self-supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks on point clouds. We also propose a novel method for sequential dataset split generation based on iterative multi-label stratification, and demonstrated to achieve a +1.2% mIoU improvement over the original split proposed by SemanticKITTI dataset. A complete benchmark for semantic segmentation task was performed, with state of the art methods. Finally, we demonstrate an active learning (AL) based dataset distillation framework.

While prior work has shown how social networks respond to shocks, these studies usually treat all ties equally, despite differences in the support provided by different social relationships. Here, we conduct a computational analysis on Twitter that examines how responses to online shocks differ by the relationship type of a user dyad. We introduce a new dataset of over 13K instances of individuals' self-reporting shock events on Twitter and construct networks of relationship-labeled dyadic interactions around these events. By examining behaviors across 110K replies to shocked users in a pseudo-causal analysis, we demonstrate relationship-specific patterns in response levels and topic shifts. We also show that while well-established social dimensions of closeness such as tie strength and structural embeddedness contribute to shock responsiveness, the degree of impact is highly dependent on relationship and shock types.

Up to date, the AC prediction problem, i.e., to predict whether a pair of molecules exhibit the AC relationship, has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we first introduce ACNet, a large-scale dataset for AC prediction. ACNet curates over 400K Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) against 190 targets, including over 20K MMP-cliffs and 380K non-AC MMPs, and provides five subsets for model development and evaluation.

Our experimental results show that deep learning models can achieve good performance when the models are trained on tasks with adequate amount of data, while the imbalanced, low-data and out-of-distribution features of the ACNet dataset still make it challenging for deep neural networks to cope with.

We first propose edge-level immunization to vaccinate node pairs. Despite the primary success, such edge-level immunization cannot defend against emerging node injection attacks, since it only immunizes existing node pairs. To this end, we further propose node-level immunization. To circumvent computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving adversarial immunization, we design AdvImmune-Edge and AdvImmune-Node algorithms to effectively obtain the immune node pairs or nodes. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdvImmune methods. In particular, AdvImmune-Node remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 79%, 294%, and 100%, after immunizing only 5% nodes.

{"title":"Balancing Privacy Protection and Interpretability in Federated Learning","description":"Federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train the global model in a distributed manner by sharing the model parameters from local clients to a central server, thereby potentially protecting users' private information.

To deal with this issue, differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local models before aggregation.

{"title":"Log Parsing with Prompt-based Few-shot Learning","description":"Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07435v1","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Log Parsing with Prompt-based Few-shot Learning Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems.

{"title":"URCDC-Depth: Uncertainty Rectified Cross-Distillation with CutFlip for Monocular Depth Estimation","description":"This work aims to estimate a high-quality depth map from a single RGB image. Due to the lack of depth clues, making full use of the long-range correlation and the local information is critical for accurate depth estimation. Towards this end, we introduce an uncertainty rectified cross-distillation between Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a unified depth estimator. Specifically, we use the depth estimates derived from the Transformer branch and the CNN branch as pseudo labels to teach each other. Meanwhile, we model the pixel-wise depth uncertainty to rectify the loss weights of noisy depth labels. To avoid the large performance gap induced by the strong Transformer branch deteriorating the cross-distillation, we transfer the feature maps from Transformer to CNN and design coupling units to assist the weak CNN branch to utilize the transferred features. Furthermore, we propose a surprisingly simple yet highly effective data augmentation technique CutFlip, which enforces the model to exploit more valuable clues apart from the clue of vertical image position for depth estimation.

{"title":"Fossil Image Identification using Deep Learning Ensembles of Data Augmented Multiviews","description":"Identification of fossil species is crucial to evolutionary studies. Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to the training of deep learning based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a novel multiview ensemble framework, which collects multiple views of each fossil specimen image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base deep learning models and then makes final decisions via soft voting. We further develop OGS method that integrates original, gray, and skeleton views under this framework to demonstrate the effectiveness. Experimental results on the fusulinid fossil dataset over five deep learning based milestone models show that OGS using three base models consistently outperforms the baseline using a single base model, and the ablation study verifies the usefulness of each selected view. Besides, OGS obtains the superior or comparable performance compared to the method under well-known bagging framework. Moreover, as the available training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more performance gains compared to the baseline. Furthermore, a consistency test with two human experts shows that OGS obtains the highest agreement with both the labels of dataset and the two experts. Notably, this methodology is designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to see applications on other fossil datasets.

{"title":"Vector-based Efficient Data Hiding in Encrypted Images via Multi-MSB Replacement","description":"As an essential technique for data privacy protection, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) methods have drawn intensive research interest in recent years. In response to the increasing demand for protecting data privacy, novel methods that perform RDHEI are continually being developed. We propose two effective multi-MSB (most significant bit) replacement-based approaches that yield comparably high data embedding capacity, improve overall processing speed, and enhance reconstructed images' quality. Our first method, Efficient Multi-MSB Replacement-RDHEI (EMR-RDHEI), obtains higher data embedding rates (DERs, also known as payloads) and better visual quality in reconstructed images when compared with many other state-of-the-art methods. Our second method, Lossless Multi-MSB Replacement-RDHEI (LMR-RDHEI), can losslessly recover original images after an information embedding process is performed. To verify the accuracy of our methods, we compared them with other recent RDHEI techniques and performed extensive experiments using the widely accepted BOWS-2 dataset. Our experimental results showed that the DER of our EMR-RDHEI method ranged from 1.2087 bit per pixel (bpp) to 6.2682 bpp with an average of 3.2457 bpp. For the LMR-RDHEI method, the average DER was 2.5325 bpp, with a range between 0.2129 bpp and 6.0168 bpp. Our results demonstrate that these methods outperform many other state-of-the-art RDHEI algorithms.

{"title":"Clustering-Based Inter-Regional Correlation Estimation","description":"A novel non-parametric estimator of the correlation between grouped measurements of a quantity is proposed in the presence of noise. This work is primarily motivated by functional brain network construction from fMRI data, where brain regions correspond to groups of spatial units, and correlation between region pairs defines the network. The challenge resides in the fact that both noise and intra-regional correlation lead to inconsistent inter-regional correlation estimation using classical approaches. While some existing methods handle either one of these issues, no non-parametric approaches tackle both simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a trade-off between two procedures: correlating regional averages, which is not robust to intra-regional correlation; and averaging pairwise inter-regional correlations, which is not robust to noise. To that end, we project the data onto a space where Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for sample correlation. We then propose to leverage hierarchical clustering to gather together highly correlated variables within each region prior to inter-regional correlation estimation.

{"title":"[R] Does a new published ML dataset always need to have an official train-dev-test split? Should the test set be made balanced?","description":"I have constructed a novel ML (NLP) dataset for classification and labeled it with three classes. The dataset is rather small with about 700 examples, out of which the classes have about 400, 200, and 100 examples respectively. I would like to publish it and describe it in an official publication for a workshop or a conference.\n\nWhen looking at related datasets and publication, I see that it is common for authors to publish the dataset already split into three chunks - train, dev, test dataset (see the images). It is also common in these papers to provide the performance of baseline models on the dataset. Considering the dataset's small size, I feel like doing a 5-fold cross-validation would be a good alternative for such a small dataset, rather than doing something like a split into 450-100-150 train-dev-test datasets and then evaluating only on the very small dataset with 150 examples. Still, I believe that for better replicability, doing an \"official\" split is preferred and then everyone in the future testing on the same test set with 150 examples? Why do the authors usually already provide the three splits?\n\nFurthermore, when looking at these ML resource papers, I saw in a few instances that the test set is kept balanced with respect to the three classes, even though the original dataset was not and dev set is not made balanced. This is problematic in my case for my third class where there are only about 100 examples. If I make my test set to be 50-50-50 for class1-class2-class3, then there is only 50 examples of class3 left for train+dev! That is simply infeasible for the training set. None of the authors provide any sort of explanation why they split it like this, they just seem to say \"here is our split\". Is this done to discourage the model from just doing a majority-class prediction and thus make it challenging? Or because a dummy classifier would have a 60% accuracy?

{"title":"How to debug Python applications","description":"# \n\n[How to debug Python applications](https://preview.redd.it/s5qps8ns2jia1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c8bfff4fbe2c52e9611f2169fa4cb9de91829322)\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn software development, testing is an essential part of ensuring that code works as intended. One critical aspect of testing is debugging, which involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In this article, we'll explore how to debug Python applications and highlight some of the most commonly used methods for debugging Python code.\n\n## Debugging options\n\nWhen it comes to debugging Python, there are multiple options available, and you should consider which one suits your needs best. Two popular options are IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools.\n\n## IDE Debugging Tools\n\nIDEs like PyCharm and VSCode offer debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints in your code and run it in debug mode. This allows you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. Here are some resources for learning how to use the debugging tools in PyCharm and VSCode:\n\n* [Debugging Python in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html)\n* [Debugging Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)\n\n## Package Debugging Tools\n\nLinks:\n\n* [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n* [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)\n* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)\n\nPython also offers built-in debugging tools, such as the `pdb` module, which allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code in a console-based debugger. Additionally, there are alternative packages like `ipdb`, which is based on the `IPython` tool and provides a more powerful debugger. Here is an example of how to use the `pdb` module in your code:\n\n**my\\_module.py**\n\n    def something(val: str) -&gt; int:\n        val += \" world\"\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n        # If you want a more powerful debugger, use `ipdb`.\n        # Note, that this requires installation of `ipdb`\n        #     $ pip install ipdb\n        # Then, comment out the `mport pdb; ...` and \n        # uncomment the following line:\n        # import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n    \n    my_str = \"Hello\"\n    \n    print(something(my_str))\n\nIn the example code above, we set a breakpoint in the `something()` function using the `pdb.set_trace()` function. When the code reaches this point, it will pause execution and drop into the debugger, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n\n**Run it**\n\n    python my_module.py\n\n**What would you see**\n\n    $ python my_module.py \n    --Return--\n    &gt; /home/artur.local/repos/tryouts/debug/my_module.py(3)something()-&gt;None\n    -&gt; import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n    (Pdb) locals()\n    {'val': 'Hello world', 'pdb': &lt;module 'pdb' from '/usr/lib64/python3.11/pdb.py'&gt;, '__return__': None}\n    (Pdb) val\n    'Hello world'\n    (Pdb)\n\nStudy `pdb` documentation for more.\n\n**Good to know**\n\nIt works similarly with your web views (like, FastAPI/Flask/Django).\n\n    def your_view(request):\n       # ...\n       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\n## Best Practices for Debugging Python\n\nWhile debugging is an essential part of the development process, there are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable.\n\n## Don't commit your debug code!\n\nLinks:\n\n* [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)\n\nOne critical practice is to avoid committing your debug code to your code repository. Debug code can clutter your codebase and make it more challenging to maintain. To avoid committing debug code, use a tool like `pre-commit` and linters like `ruff` to catch and prevent it from being committed.\n\n## Debugging in Docker\n\nIf you use Docker for development, you need to configure your `docker-compose.yml` to allow debugging. You can do this by setting the `stdin_open` and `tty` options for your service:\n\n    version: '3'\n    \n    services:\n      api:\n        # Other configuration\n        stdin_open: true\n        tty: true\n\nAfter configuring your Docker environment, assuming that you have it running already, you can find the container ID (`CONTAINER ID`) for your service (in the example above - `api` service) using `docker ps` and attach to it with the `docker attach` (`docker attach {CONTAINER ID}`) command to start debugging. Note, that you will need to run the `docker attach` command in a separate shell/terminal tab and that's where the debug prompt will appear.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDebugging Python is an essential skill for any developer, and it's crucial to understand the available options and best practices. In this article, we explored two popular options for debugging Python: IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools. We also highlighted some best practices for debugging in Python, including avoiding committing debug code and configuring Docker for debugging. With this knowledge, you'll be better equipped to debug Python applications and write clean, maintainable code.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/113n1dd/how_to_debug_python_applications/","created":"2023-02-16","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":1},"text":"How to debug Python applications # \n\n[How to debug Python applications](https://preview.redd.it/s5qps8ns2jia1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c8bfff4fbe2c52e9611f2169fa4cb9de91829322)\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn software development, testing is an essential part of ensuring that code works as intended. One critical aspect of testing is debugging, which involves finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In this article, we'll explore how to debug Python applications and highlight some of the most commonly used methods for debugging Python code.\n\n## Debugging options\n\nWhen it comes to debugging Python, there are multiple options available, and you should consider which one suits your needs best. Two popular options are IDE debugging tools and package debugging tools.\n\n## IDE Debugging Tools\n\nIDEs like PyCharm and VSCode offer debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints in your code and run it in debug mode. This allows you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. Here are some resources for learning how to use the debugging tools in PyCharm and VSCode:\n\n* [Debugging Python in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html)\n* [Debugging Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)\n\n## Package Debugging Tools\n\nLinks:\n\n* [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n* [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/)\n* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html)\n\nPython also offers built-in debugging tools, such as the `pdb` module, which allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code in a console-based debugger. Additionally, there are alternative packages like `ipdb`, which is based on the `IPython` tool and provides a more powerful debugger. Here is an example of how to use the `pdb` module in your code:\n\n**my\\_module.py**\n\n    def something(val: str) -&gt; int:\n        val += \" world\"\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n        # If you want a more powerful debugger, use `ipdb`.\n        # Note, that this requires installation of `ipdb`\n        #     $ pip install ipdb\n        # Then, comment out the `mport pdb; ...` and \n        # uncomment the following line:\n        # import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()\n    \n    my_str = \"Hello\"\n    \n    print(something(my_str))\n\nIn the example code above, we set a breakpoint in the `something()` function using the `pdb.set_trace()` function. When the code reaches this point, it will pause execution and drop into the debugger, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n\n**Run it**\n\n    python my_module.py\n\n**What would you see**\n\n    $ python my_module.py \n    --Return--\n    &gt; /home/artur.local/repos/tryouts/debug/my_module.py(3)something()-&gt;None\n    -&gt; import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # set a breakpoint\n    (Pdb) locals()\n    {'val': 'Hello world', 'pdb': &lt;module 'pdb' from '/usr/lib64/python3.11/pdb.py'&gt;, '__return__': None}\n    (Pdb) val\n    'Hello world'\n    (Pdb)\n\nStudy `pdb` documentation for more.\n\n**Good to know**\n\nIt works similarly with your web views (like, FastAPI/Flask/Django).\n\n    def your_view(request):\n       # ...\n       import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\n## Best Practices for Debugging Python\n\nWhile debugging is an essential part of the development process, there are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable.\n\n## Don't commit your debug code!\n\nLinks:\n\n* [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/)\n* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)\n\nOne critical practice is to avoid committing your debug code to your code repository.

The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms of dominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, and referred as DominatingSet. Our algorithm shows better scene coverage in comparison to other methodologies that are used for database creation. Also, we demonstrate that using DominatingSet, a database size could be up to 250-1400 times smaller than the original scanning sequence while maintaining a recall rate of more than 80% on testing sequences. We evaluated our algorithm on 7-scenes and BundleFusion datasets and an additionally recorded sequence in a highly repetitive office setting. In addition, the database selection can produce weakly-supervised labels for fine-tuning neural place recognition algorithms to particular settings, improving even more their accuracy. The paper also presents a fully automated pipeline for VPR database creation from RGBD scanning sequences, as well as a set of metrics for VPR database evaluation.

These mismatches may lead to inaccurate predictions and errors, resulting in poor product quality and unreliable systems. In this study, we propose StyleDiff to inform developers of the differences between the two datasets for the steady development of machine learning systems. Using disentangled image spaces obtained from recently proposed generative models, StyleDiff compares the two datasets by focusing on attributes in the images and provides an easy-to-understand analysis of the differences between the datasets. The proposed StyleDiff performs in $O (d N\\log N)$, where $N$ is the size of the datasets and $d$ is the number of attributes, enabling the application to large datasets.

{"title":"Contributing to Accessibility Datasets: Reflections on Sharing Study Data by Blind People","description":"To ensure that AI-infused systems work for disabled people, we need to bring accessibility datasets sourced from this community in the development lifecycle. However, there are many ethical and privacy concerns limiting greater data inclusion, making such datasets not readily available. We present a pair of studies where 13 blind participants engage in data capturing activities and reflect with and without probing on various factors that influence their decision to share their data via an AI dataset. We see how different factors influence blind participants' willingness to share study data as they assess risk-benefit tradeoffs. The majority support sharing of their data to improve technology but also express concerns over commercial use, associated metadata, and the lack of transparency about the impact of their data. These insights have implications for the development of responsible practices for stewarding accessibility datasets, and can contribute to broader discussions in this area.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04962v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Contributing to Accessibility Datasets: Reflections on Sharing Study Data by Blind People To ensure that AI-infused systems work for disabled people, we need to bring accessibility datasets sourced from this community in the development lifecycle.

We see how different factors influence blind participants' willingness to share study data as they assess risk-benefit tradeoffs. The majority support sharing of their data to improve technology but also express concerns over commercial use, associated metadata, and the lack of transparency about the impact of their data. These insights have implications for the development of responsible practices for stewarding accessibility datasets, and can contribute to broader discussions in this area.","classes":{"dataset":0.9674330354,"prompteng":0.0006481268}}
{"title":"FedREP: A Byzantine-Robust, Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Federated Learning","description":"Federated learning (FL) has recently become a hot research topic, in which Byzantine robustness, communication efficiency and privacy preservation are three important aspects. However, the tension among these three aspects makes it hard to simultaneously take all of them into account. In view of this challenge, we theoretically analyze the conditions that a communication compression method should satisfy to be compatible with existing Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Motivated by the analysis results, we propose a novel communication compression method called consensus sparsification (ConSpar). To the best of our knowledge, ConSpar is the first communication compression method that is designed to be compatible with both Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Based on ConSpar, we further propose a novel FL framework called FedREP, which is Byzantine-robust, communication-efficient and privacy-preserving. We theoretically prove the Byzantine robustness and the convergence of FedREP. Empirical results show that FedREP can significantly outperform communication-efficient privacy-preserving baselines. Furthermore, compared with Byzantine-robust communication-efficient baselines, FedREP can achieve comparable accuracy with the extra advantage of privacy preservation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05206v1","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"FedREP: A Byzantine-Robust, Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Federated Learning Federated learning (FL) has recently become a hot research topic, in which Byzantine robustness, communication efficiency and privacy preservation are three important aspects.

{"title":"Greener yet Powerful: Taming Large Code Generation Models with Quantization","description":"ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner, by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have substantially pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. Despite their great power, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant threat to adapting them in a regular software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server to develop her code. Such large models incur significant resource usage (in terms of memory, latency, and dollars) as well as carbon footprint.   Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges. Several techniques are proposed to compress large pretrained models typically used for vision or textual data. Out of many available compression techniques, we identified that quantization is mostly applicable for code generation task as it does not require significant retraining cost. As quantization represents model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and runtime latency would both benefit from such int representation. We extensively study the impact of quantized model on code generation tasks across different dimension: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. To this end, through systematic experiments we find a recipe of quantization technique that could run even a $6$B model in a regular laptop without significant accuracy or robustness degradation.

{"title":"Intriguing Property of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation","description":"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, we discover an extraordinary phenomenon: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Based on this discovery, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively.

{"title":"Parallel Filtered Graphs for Hierarchical Clustering","description":"Given all pairwise weights (distances) among a set of objects, filtered graphs provide a sparse representation by only keeping an important subset of weights. Such graphs can be passed to graph clustering algorithms to generate hierarchical clusters.

We propose a new parallel algorithm for constructing triangulated maximally filtered graphs (TMFG), which produces valid inputs for DBHT, and a scalable parallel algorithm for generating DBHTs that is optimized for TMFG inputs. In addition to parallelizing the original TMFG construction, which has limited parallelism, we also design a new algorithm that inserts multiple vertices on each round to enable more parallelism. We show that the graphs generated by our new algorithm have similar quality compared to the original TMFGs, while being much faster to generate.

I know for a fact that I will only use my model on this one camera and that the position and rotation of my camera will never change. Normally when building a dataset, especially for computer vision models, you want to include diverse data to ensure that objects can be detected regardless of their surroundings. However in this case one can make the assumption that the surroundings will largely be static other than some minor variations. For this example does it make more sense to train a model on images collected from the perspective of the camera itself, or should a variety of dog pictures in various environments still be used? My thought process is that if we know enough about the conditions the model will be deployed in it would make more sense to provide training data that reflects this real world usage, but pretty much all the sources I've found online always say your dataset should be diverse. I'm curious to hear what reddit's thoughts on this approach are, or if there's any research that's been done into this topic that I've missed.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11mvjtu/d_is_a_diverse_dataset_necessary_for_accuracy_if/","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["machinelearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":3},"text":"[D] Is a diverse dataset necessary for accuracy if the conditions in which inference will be used are narrow?

It's worth noting that my main interest in NLP is prompt-based applications, rather than text completion.","classes":{"dataset":0.5109590292,"prompteng":0.0238072742}}

I've created a Google sheets file that's set up with formulas to crunch all the numbers for me. All I have to do is copy that delivery data from the website to the sheet and it automaticly calculates the rest. The website takes 60 seconds at least to collect the delivery data on one delivery. I compare it to what I have in the sheet and add in the new information. In order to keep up with the deliveries, I usually try to do data entry on about 100 entries each day.

{"title":"Knowledge Accumulation in Continually Learned Representations and the Issue of Feature Forgetting","description":"By default, neural networks learn on all training data at once. When such a model is trained on sequential chunks of new data, it tends to catastrophically forget how to handle old data. In this work we investigate how continual learners learn and forget representations. We observe two phenomena: knowledge accumulation, i.e. the improvement of a representation over time, and feature forgetting, i.e. the loss of task-specific representations. To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one.

When such a model is trained on sequential chunks of new data, it tends to catastrophically forget how to handle old data. In this work we investigate how continual learners learn and forget representations. We observe two phenomena: knowledge accumulation, i.e. the improvement of a representation over time, and feature forgetting, i.e. the loss of task-specific representations. To better understand both phenomena, we introduce a new analysis technique called task exclusion comparison. If a model has seen a task and it has not forgotten all the task-specific features, then its representation for that task should be better than that of a model that was trained on similar tasks, but not that exact one. Our image classification experiments show that most task-specific features are quickly forgotten, in contrast to what has been suggested in the past. Further, we demonstrate how some continual learning methods, like replay, and ideas from representation learning affect a continually learned representation.

{"title":"Adoption of Adaptive Learning Platforms in Schools: Unveiling Factors Influencing Teachers Engagement","description":"Albeit existing evidence about the impact of AI-based adaptive learning platforms, their scaled adoption in schools is slow at best. In addition, AI tools adopted in schools may not always be the considered and studied re-search products of the research community. Therefore, there have been in-creasing concerns about identifying factors influencing adoption, and studying the extent to which these factors can be used to predict teachers engagement with adaptive learning platforms. To address this, we developed a reliable instrument to measure more holistic factors influencing teachers adoption of adaptive learning platforms in schools. In addition, we present the results of its implementation with school teachers (n=792) sampled from a large country-level population and use this data to predict teachers real-world engagement with the adaptive learning platform in schools. Our results show that although teachers knowledge, confidence and product quality are all important factors, they are not necessarily the only, may not even be the most important factors influencing the teachers engagement with AI platforms in schools. Not generating any additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating support mechanisms for help, and assuring that ethical issues are minimised, are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers engagement with the platform better. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the value of factors identified to increase the real-world adoption and effectiveness of adaptive learning platforms by increasing the dimensions of variability in prediction models and decreasing the implementation variability in practice.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00903v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Adoption of Adaptive Learning Platforms in Schools: Unveiling Factors Influencing Teachers Engagement Albeit existing evidence about the impact of AI-based adaptive learning platforms, their scaled adoption in schools is slow at best.

{"title":"MetaHead: An Engine to Create Realistic Digital Head","description":"Collecting and labeling training data is one important step for learning-based methods because the process is time-consuming and biased. For face analysis tasks, although some generative models can be used to generate face data, they can only achieve a subset of generation diversity, reconstruction accuracy, 3D consistency, high-fidelity visual quality, and easy editability. One recent related work is the graphics-based generative method, but it can only render low realism head with high computation cost. In this paper, we propose MetaHead, a unified and full-featured controllable digital head engine, which consists of a controllable head radiance field(MetaHead-F) to super-realistically generate or reconstruct view-consistent 3D controllable digital heads and a generic top-down image generation framework LabelHead to generate digital heads consistent with the given customizable feature labels. Experiments validate that our controllable digital head engine achieves the state-of-the-art generation visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the generated labeled data can assist real training data and significantly surpass the labeled data generated by graphics-based methods in terms of training effect.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00838v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"MetaHead: An Engine to Create Realistic Digital Head Collecting and labeling training data is one important step for learning-based methods because the process is time-consuming and biased.

{"title":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images","description":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRFs). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all DRF.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00725v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare.

{"title":"Accuracy Improvement of Object Detection in VVC Coded Video Using YOLO-v7 Features","description":"With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread. As the amount of video used for image recognition increases, efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general, when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video. Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method, since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance. The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection accuracy.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00689v1","created":"2023-04-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Accuracy Improvement of Object Detection in VVC Coded Video Using YOLO-v7 Features With advances in image recognition technology based on deep learning, automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more widespread.

In the last couple of weeks I created a small Python based project series on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

{"title":"Unleashing Infinite-Length Input Capacity for Large-scale Language Models with Self-Controlled Memory System","description":"Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by their inability to process lengthy inputs. To address this limitation, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory (SCM) system to unleash infinite-length input capacity for large-scale language models. Our SCM system is composed of three key modules: the language model agent, the memory stream, and the memory controller. The language model agent iteratively processes ultra-long inputs and stores all historical information in the memory stream. The memory controller provides the agent with both long-term memory (archived memory) and short-term memory (flash memory) to generate precise and coherent responses. The controller determines which memories from archived memory should be activated and how to incorporate them into the model input. Our SCM system can be integrated with any LLMs to enable them to process ultra-long texts without any modification or fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our SCM system enables LLMs, which are not optimized for multi-turn dialogue, to achieve multi-turn dialogue capabilities that are comparable to ChatGPT, and to outperform ChatGPT in scenarios involving ultra-long document summarization or long-term conversations.

{"title":"Explainable Automated Debugging via Large Language Model-driven Scientific Debugging","description":"Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry. However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02195v1","created":"2023-04-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Explainable Automated Debugging via Large Language Model-driven Scientific Debugging Automated debugging techniques have the potential to reduce developer effort in debugging, and have matured enough to be adopted by industry.

Yet most previous methods simply apply fixed composition of data augmentations to improve data efficiency, which ignores the changes in their optimal settings over training.

In this work, we propose AdDA, which implements a closed-loop feedback structure to a generic contrastive learning network. AdDA works by allowing the network to adaptively adjust the augmentation compositions according to the real-time feedback.

To address this shortcoming in the machine learning ecosystem, we introduce DataComp, a benchmark where the training code is fixed and researchers innovate by proposing new training sets. We provide a testbed for dataset experiments centered around a new candidate pool of 12.8B image-text pairs from Common Crawl. Participants in our benchmark design new filtering techniques or curate new data sources and then evaluate their new dataset by running our standardized CLIP training code and testing on 38 downstream test sets. Our benchmark consists of multiple scales, with four candidate pool sizes and associated compute budgets ranging from 12.8M to 12.8B samples seen during training. This multi-scale design facilitates the study of scaling trends and makes the benchmark accessible to researchers with varying resources.   Our baseline experiments show that the DataComp workflow is a promising way of improving multimodal datasets.

To this end, we retrained the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) 2 method, which was originally designed for contact-based fingerprints, with a synthetic contactless fingerprint database. We evaluate the predictive performance of the resulting MCLFIQ model in terms of Error-vs.-Discard Characteristic (EDC) curves on three real-world contactless fingerprint databases using two recognition algorithms. In experiments, the MCLFIQ method is compared against the original NFIQ 2 method and a sharpness-based quality assessment algorithm developed for contactless fingerprint images.

Its spatial pattern depends on social, economic, political, and regional variables. Artificial intelligence has shown immense scope in analyzing the complexities and nuances of poverty. The proposed project aims to examine the poverty situation of rural India for the period of 1990-2022 based on the quality of life and livelihood indicators. The districts will be classified into `advanced', `catching up', `falling behind', and `lagged' regions. The project proposes to integrate multiple data sources, including conventional national-level large sample household surveys, census surveys, and proxy variables like daytime, and nighttime data from satellite images, and communication networks, to name a few, to provide a comprehensive view of poverty at the district level. The project also intends to examine causation and longitudinal analysis to examine the reasons for poverty. Poverty and inequality could be widening in developing countries due to demographic and growth-agglomerating policies. Therefore, targeting the lagging regions and the vulnerable population is essential to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life to achieve the goal of `zero poverty'.

Confirming this hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical and thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting.

We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark.

This demonstrates the extraordinary performance of contemporary foundation models.

In terms of sample generation quality, the GAN is significantly better than a random distribution (noise) in mean distance, for all classes. In the classification tests, the baseline neural network was not capable of identifying untrained gestures. When the proposed methodology was implemented, we found that there is a trade-off between the detection of trained and untrained gestures, with some trained samples being mistaken as novelty.

In addition, each service center is also associated with a notion of capacity and a penalty which is incurred if it gets overloaded. Given the input, the LBDD problem determines a mapping from the set of demand units to the set of service centers. The objective is to determine a mapping that minimizes the sum of the following two terms: (i) the total assignment cost between demand units and their allotted service centers and, (ii) total of penalties incurred. The problem of LBDD finds its application in the domain of urban planning. An instance of the LBDD problem can be reduced to an instance of the min-cost bi-partite matching problem. However, this approach cannot scale up to the real world large problem instances.

This paper proposes a novel allotment subspace re-adjustment based approach (ASRAL) for the LBDD problem. We analyze ASRAL theoretically and present its asymptotic time complexity. We also evaluate ASRAL experimentally on large problem instances and compare with alternative approaches.

{"title":"GeneFace++: Generalized and Stable Real-Time Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Generation","description":"Generating talking person portraits with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial problem in the field of digital human and metaverse. A modern talking face generation method is expected to achieve the goals of generalized audio-lip synchronization, good video quality, and high system efficiency. Recently, neural radiance field (NeRF) has become a popular rendering technique in this field since it could achieve high-fidelity and 3D-consistent talking face generation with a few-minute-long training video. However, there still exist several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization, it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal consistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the limited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain input condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the system efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF severely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour as an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion prediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to regulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness issues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video renderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference. With these settings, GeneFace++ becomes the first NeRF-based method that achieves stable and real-time talking face generation with generalized audio-lip synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluation.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly address this issue and deal with two major drawbacks of the existing state-of-the-art approaches, namely that they (i) require the costly training of additional, purpose-trained neural networks, and/or (ii) fail to retain the facial attributes of the original images in the anonymized counterparts, the preservation of which is of paramount importance for their use in downstream tasks. We accordingly present a task-agnostic anonymization procedure that directly optimizes the images' latent representation in the latent space of a pre-trained GAN.

{"title":"I2Edit: Towards Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing via Dialogue","description":"Although there have been considerable research efforts on controllable facial image editing, the desirable interactive setting where the users can interact with the system to adjust their requirements dynamically hasn't been well explored. This paper focuses on facial image editing via dialogue and introduces a new benchmark dataset, Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing (I2Edit), for evaluating image editing quality and interaction ability in real-world interactive facial editing scenarios. The dataset is constructed upon the CelebA-HQ dataset with images annotated with a multi-turn dialogue that corresponds to the user editing requirements. I2Edit is challenging, as it needs to 1) track the dynamically updated user requirements and edit the images accordingly, as well as 2) generate the appropriate natural language response to communicate with the user. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of a dialogue module and an image editing module. The former is for user edit requirements tracking and generating the corresponding indicative responses, while the latter edits the images conditioned on the tracked user edit requirements. In contrast to previous works that simply treat multi-turn interaction as a sequence of single-turn interactions, we extract the user edit requirements from the whole dialogue history instead of the current single turn. The extracted global user edit requirements enable us to directly edit the input raw image to avoid error accumulation and attribute forgetting issues. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the I2Edit dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework over the previous single-turn methods.

{"title":"From Sparse to Precise: A Practical Editing Approach for Intracardiac Echocardiography Segmentation","description":"Accurate and safe catheter ablation procedures for patients with atrial fibrillation require precise segmentation of cardiac structures in Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) imaging. Prior studies have suggested methods that employ 3D geometry information from the ICE transducer to create a sparse ICE volume by placing 2D frames in a 3D grid, enabling training of 3D segmentation models. However, the resulting 3D masks from these models can be inaccurate and may lead to serious clinical complications due to the sparse sampling in ICE data, frames misalignment, and cardiac motion. To address this issue, we propose an interactive editing framework that allows users to edit segmentation output by drawing scribbles on a 2D frame. The user interaction is mapped to the 3D grid and utilized to execute an editing step that modifies the segmentation in the vicinity of the interaction while preserving the previous segmentation away from the interaction. Furthermore, our framework accommodates multiple edits to the segmentation output in a sequential manner without compromising previous edits. This paper presents a novel loss function and a novel evaluation metric specifically designed for editing. Results from cross-validation and testing indicate that our proposed loss function outperforms standard losses and training strategies in terms of segmentation quality and following user input. Additionally, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that subsequent edits do not compromise previous edits when using our method, as opposed to standard segmentation losses.

{"title":"LFACon: Introducing Anglewise Attention to No-Reference Quality Assessment in Light Field Space","description":"Light field imaging can capture both the intensity information and the direction information of light rays. It naturally enables a six-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual reality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment (LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but also the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of metrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular quality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics suffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of \"anglewise attention\" by introducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an LFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose three new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid attention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize angular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively, and reduce the computational cost of feature extraction.

It naturally enables a six-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual reality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment (LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but also the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of metrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular quality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics suffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of \"anglewise attention\" by introducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an LFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose three new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid attention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize angular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively, and reduce the computational cost of feature extraction. By effectively incorporating the proposed kernels, we further propose our light field attentional convolutional neural network (LFACon) as an LFIQA metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed LFACon metric significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art LFIQA metrics. For the majority of distortion types, LFACon attains the best performance with lower complexity and less computational time.","classes":{"dataset":0.1589827091,"prompteng":0.0219986811}}

{"title":"[P] Make AI Robust and Trustworthy with CAPSA!","description":"Modern AI models show great potential across various applications, but their deployment in everyday life is limited due to a lack of trustworthiness. While accuracy is crucial, AI models must also recognize when they can and cannot be trusted to make decisions, especially in safety-critical systems. To bridge this gap, it\u2019s essential to develop AI models with built-in trust mechanisms for reliable decision-making in real-world scenarios.\n\nTrustworthiness in AI models can be improved by addressing three risk sources: Representation Bias, Epistemic Uncertainty, and Aleatoric Uncertainty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Representation Bias refers to the potential for the model to favor certain groups or types of data over others, leading to inaccuracies in its predictions with under-represented data.\n* Epistemic Uncertainty, also known as Model Uncertainty, describes the uncertainty associated with the model\u2019s ability to make accurate predictions based on the data it has been trained on. Epistemic uncertainty can be improved by training the model longer, or picking a model architecture with higher predictive capacity.\n* Aleatoric Uncertainty, also known as Data Uncertainty, refers to the inherent noise or unpredictability in the data itself. This type of uncertainty can arise due to factors such as measurement errors, labeling errors, or natural variations in the data. This can only be improved by improving the data source, or manually fixing the inherent issues that lie within the dataset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo address this issue of AI trust and gain knowledge of the risk metrics mentioned above, we are open-sourcing CAPSA -- a tool that automates the creation of robust and trustworthy neural networks!

The majority of side-effect-related posts discuss it in the context of functional programming ([this one](https://thejs.dev/jmitchell/what-are-side-effects-and-what-you-can-do-about-them-jws), another [very good one from Jesse Warden](https://jessewarden.com/books/real-world-functional-programming/part1/01_input_output_side_effects.html), [one more](https://www.yld.io/blog/the-not-so-scary-guide-to-functional-programming/)). \n\nBut I just wanted to make a short list that you can pull out when needed. So here we go:\n\nCode with side effects  \n \\- is fragile - leads to unexpected crashes  \n \\- is unexpectedly slow and is hard to optimize  \n \\- is hard to use concurrently  \n \\- is hard to read and understand  \n \\- it is hard to reuse  \n \\- is hard to debug, release and write tests\n\nI put more detailed arguments into [a Medium post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-dangers-of-side-effects-for-python-coders-fdf0743457a3) on each of those items.\n\nWhat do you think?","classes":{"dataset":0.1411729604,"prompteng":0.2917619348}}

{"title":"Modeling Entities as Semantic Points for Visual Information Extraction in the Wild","description":"Recently, Visual Information Extraction (VIE) has been becoming increasingly important in both the academia and industry, due to the wide range of real-world applications. Previously, numerous works have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, the benchmarks used to assess these methods are relatively plain, i.e., scenarios with real-world complexity are not fully represented in these benchmarks. As the first contribution of this work, we curate and release a new dataset for VIE, in which the document images are much more challenging in that they are taken from real applications, and difficulties such as blur, partial occlusion, and printing shift are quite common. All these factors may lead to failures in information extraction. Therefore, as the second contribution, we explore an alternative approach to precisely and robustly extract key information from document images under such tough conditions. Specifically, in contrast to previous methods, which usually either incorporate visual information into a multi-modal architecture or train text spotting and information extraction in an end-to-end fashion, we explicitly model entities as semantic points, i.e., center points of entities are enriched with semantic information describing the attributes and relationships of different entities, which could largely benefit entity labeling and linking.

Conclusion: The proposed model can identify unknown artefacts in images with acceptable accuracy, which makes it suitable for medical applications and quality assessment of large cohorts.","classes":{"dataset":0.4116625786,"prompteng":0.0082972432}}
{"title":"Explore the Power of Synthetic Data on Few-shot Object Detection","description":"Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to expand an object detector for novel categories given only a few instances for training. The few training samples restrict the performance of FSOD model. Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-quality images. How applicable these synthetic images are for FSOD tasks remains under-explored. This work extensively studies how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art text-to-image generators benefit FSOD tasks. We focus on two perspectives: (1) How to use synthetic data for FSOD? (2) How to find representative samples from the large-scale synthetic dataset? We design a copy-paste-based pipeline for using synthetic data. Specifically, saliency object detection is applied to the original generated image, and the minimum enclosing box is used for cropping the main object based on the saliency map. After that, the cropped object is randomly pasted on the image, which comes from the base dataset. We also study the influence of the input text of text-to-image generator and the number of synthetic images used. To construct a representative synthetic training dataset, we maximize the diversity of the selected images via a sample-based and cluster-based method. However, the severe problem of high false positives (FP) ratio of novel categories in FSOD can not be solved by using synthetic data. We propose integrating CLIP, a zero-shot recognition model, into the FSOD pipeline, which can filter 90% of FP by defining a threshold for the similarity score between the detected object and the text of the predicted category. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of our method, in which performance gain is up to 21.9% compared to the few-shot baseline.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13221v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Explore the Power of Synthetic Data on Few-shot Object Detection Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to expand an object detector for novel categories given only a few instances for training.

{"title":"Defining Quality Requirements for a Trustworthy AI Wildflower Monitoring Platform","description":"For an AI solution to evolve from a trained machine learning model into a production-ready AI system, many more things need to be considered than just the performance of the machine learning model. A production-ready AI system needs to be trustworthy, i.e. of high quality. But how to determine this in practice? For traditional software, ISO25000 and its predecessors have since long time been used to define and measure quality characteristics. Recently, quality models for AI systems, based on ISO25000, have been introduced. This paper applies one such quality model to a real-life case study: a deep learning platform for monitoring wildflowers. The paper presents three realistic scenarios sketching what it means to respectively use, extend and incrementally improve the deep learning platform for wildflower identification and counting. Next, it is shown how the quality model can be used as a structured dictionary to define quality requirements for data, model and software. Future work remains to extend the quality model with metrics, tools and best practices to aid AI engineering practitioners in implementing trustworthy AI systems.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13151v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Defining Quality Requirements for a Trustworthy AI Wildflower Monitoring Platform For an AI solution to evolve from a trained machine learning model into a production-ready AI system, many more things need to be considered than just the performance of the machine learning model.

{"title":"Forecast-Aware Model Driven LSTM","description":"Poor air quality can have a significant impact on human health. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) air quality forecasting guidance is challenged by the increasing presence of extreme air quality events due to extreme weather events such as wild fires and heatwaves. These extreme air quality events further affect human health. Traditional methods used to correct model bias make assumptions about linearity and the underlying distribution. Extreme air quality events tend to occur without a strong signal leading up to the event and this behavior tends to cause existing methods to either under or over compensate for the bias. Deep learning holds promise for air quality forecasting in the presence of extreme air quality events due to its ability to generalize and learn nonlinear problems. However, in the presence of these anomalous air quality events, standard deep network approaches that use a single network for generalizing to future forecasts, may not always provide the best performance even with a full feature-set including geography and meteorology. In this work we describe a method that combines unsupervised learning and a forecast-aware bi-directional LSTM network to perform bias correction for operational air quality forecasting using AirNow station data for ozone and PM2.5 in the continental US. Using an unsupervised clustering method trained on station geographical features such as latitude and longitude, urbanization, and elevation, the learned clusters direct training by partitioning the training data for the LSTM networks. LSTMs are forecast-aware and implemented using a unique way to perform learning forward and backwards in time across forecasting days. When comparing the RMSE of the forecast model to the RMSE of the bias corrected model, the bias corrected model shows significant improvement (27\\% lower RMSE for ozone) over the base forecast.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12963v1","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Forecast-Aware Model Driven LSTM Poor air quality can have a significant impact on human health.

DUOLINGO:**\n\na. Features of GPT - Duolingo Max integration:\n\n\\- Roleplay: Voice chat with AI for multiple communication contexts: order drinks at the cafe, plan outings, go shopping\u2026 with Duolingo characters\n\n\\- Explain My Answer: give examples and explanations for your answers in the lesson whether you choose right or wrong\n\nb.

Language models, in particular, have seen widespread use in protein research, as they have been utilized to embed proteins, generate novel ones, and predict tertiary structures. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of the use of protein generative models, reviewing 1) language models for the design of novel artificial proteins, 2) works that use non-Transformer architectures, and 3) applications in directed evolution approaches.","classes":{"dataset":0.0080232238,"prompteng":0.0797502175}}

Our method is fast (24 fps) on consumer hardware, and produces higher quality results than strong GAN-inversion baselines that require test-time optimization. To train our triplane encoder pipeline, we use only synthetic data, showing how to distill the knowledge from a pretrained 3D GAN into a feedforward encoder.

Such 3D models have applications in architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, construction, real estate, GIS, and many others. Further, the visualization of large-scale data in conjunction with the generated 3D models is often a recurring and resource-intensive task. However, a completely automated end-to-end workflow is complex, requiring many steps to achieve a high-quality visualization. Methods for building reconstruction approaches have come a long way from previously manual approaches to semi-automatic or automatic approaches. The next step after reconstructing buildings is visualizing the buildings and their context. Advances in real-time rendering using game engines have enabled the extension of building reconstruction methods to procedurally generated context generation. This paper aims to complement existing methods of 3D building generation. First, we present a literature review covering different options for procedurally generated context generation and visualization methods in-depth, focusing on workflows and data pipelines. Next, we present a semi-automated workflow that extends the building reconstruction pipeline to include procedural context generation (terrain and vegetation) using Unreal Engine and, finally, the integration of various types of large-scale urban analysis data for visualization.

The T-REX experiment deployed three digital optical modules at a depth of 3420 meters, including a light emitter module (LEM) and two light receiver modules (LRMs) equipped with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and cameras to detect light signals.

{"title":"Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon","description":"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) works impressively in some environments and fails catastrophically in others. Ideally, RL theory should be able to provide an understanding of why this is, i.e. bounds predictive of practical performance. Unfortunately, current theory does not quite have this ability. We compare standard deep RL algorithms to prior sample complexity prior bounds by introducing a new dataset, BRIDGE. It consists of 155 MDPs from common deep RL benchmarks, along with their corresponding tabular representations, which enables us to exactly compute instance-dependent bounds. We find that prior bounds do not correlate well with when deep RL succeeds vs. fails, but discover a surprising property that does. When actions with the highest Q-values under the random policy also have the highest Q-values under the optimal policy, deep RL tends to succeed; when they don't, deep RL tends to fail. We generalize this property into a new complexity measure of an MDP that we call the effective horizon, which roughly corresponds to how many steps of lookahead search are needed in order to identify the next optimal action when leaf nodes are evaluated with random rollouts. Using BRIDGE, we show that the effective horizon-based bounds are more closely reflective of the empirical performance of PPO and DQN than prior sample complexity bounds across four metrics.

{"title":"Rehabilitation Exercise Repetition Segmentation and Counting using Skeletal Body Joints","description":"Physical exercise is an essential component of rehabilitation programs that improve quality of life and reduce mortality and re-hospitalization rates. In AI-driven virtual rehabilitation programs, patients complete their exercises independently at home, while AI algorithms analyze the exercise data to provide feedback to patients and report their progress to clinicians. To analyze exercise data, the first step is to segment it into consecutive repetitions. There has been a significant amount of research performed on segmenting and counting the repetitive activities of healthy individuals using raw video data, which raises concerns regarding privacy and is computationally intensive. Previous research on patients' rehabilitation exercise segmentation relied on data collected by multiple wearable sensors, which are difficult to use at home by rehabilitation patients. Compared to healthy individuals, segmenting and counting exercise repetitions in patients is more challenging because of the irregular repetition duration and the variation between repetitions. This paper presents a novel approach for segmenting and counting the repetitions of rehabilitation exercises performed by patients, based on their skeletal body joints. Skeletal body joints can be acquired through depth cameras or computer vision techniques applied to RGB videos of patients. Various sequential neural networks are designed to analyze the sequences of skeletal body joints and perform repetition segmentation and counting. Extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise datasets, KIMORE, UI-PRMD, and IntelliRehabDS, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods. The proposed method enables accurate exercise analysis while preserving privacy, facilitating the effective delivery of virtual rehabilitation programs.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09735v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Rehabilitation Exercise Repetition Segmentation and Counting using Skeletal Body Joints Physical exercise is an essential component of rehabilitation programs that improve quality of life and reduce mortality and re-hospitalization rates.

{"title":"On the Robustness of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis: Rethinking Model, Data, and Training","description":"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at automatically inferring the specific sentiment polarities toward certain aspects of products or services behind the social media texts or reviews, which has been a fundamental application to the real-world society. Since the early 2010s, ABSA has achieved extraordinarily high accuracy with various deep neural models. However, existing ABSA models with strong in-house performances may fail to generalize to some challenging cases where the contexts are variable, i.e., low robustness to real-world environments. In this study, we propose to enhance the ABSA robustness by systematically rethinking the bottlenecks from all possible angles, including model, data, and training. First, we strengthen the current best-robust syntax-aware models by further incorporating the rich external syntactic dependencies and the labels with aspect simultaneously with a universal-syntax graph convolutional network. In the corpus perspective, we propose to automatically induce high-quality synthetic training data with various types, allowing models to learn sufficient inductive bias for better robustness. Last, we based on the rich pseudo data perform adversarial training to enhance the resistance to the context perturbation and meanwhile employ contrastive learning to reinforce the representations of instances with contrastive sentiments. Extensive robustness evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that our enhanced syntax-aware model achieves better robustness performances than all the state-of-the-art baselines. By additionally incorporating our synthetic corpus, the robust testing results are pushed with around 10% accuracy, which are then further improved by installing the advanced training strategies. In-depth analyses are presented for revealing the factors influencing the ABSA robustness.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09563v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"On the Robustness of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis: Rethinking Model, Data, and Training Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at automatically inferring the specific sentiment polarities toward certain aspects of products or services behind the social media texts or reviews, which has been a fundamental application to the real-world society.

{"title":"Local object crop collision network for efficient simulation of non-convex objects in GPU-based simulators","description":"Our goal is to develop an efficient contact detection algorithm for large-scale GPU-based simulation of non-convex objects. Current GPU-based simulators such as IsaacGym and Brax must trade-off speed with fidelity, generality, or both when simulating non-convex objects. Their main issue lies in contact detection (CD): existing CD algorithms, such as Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK), must trade off their computational speed with accuracy which becomes expensive as the number of collisions among non-convex objects increases. We propose a data-driven approach for CD, whose accuracy depends only on the quality and quantity of offline dataset rather than online computation time. Unlike GJK, our method inherently has a uniform computational flow, which facilitates efficient GPU usage based on advanced compilers such as XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). Further, we offer a data-efficient solution by learning the patterns of colliding local crop object shapes, rather than global object shapes which are harder to learn. We demonstrate our approach improves the efficiency of existing CD methods by a factor of 5-10 for non-convex objects with comparable accuracy. Using the previous work on contact resolution for a neural-network-based contact detector, we integrate our CD algorithm into the open-source GPU-based simulator, Brax, and show that we can improve the efficiency over IsaacGym and generality over standard Brax. We highly recommend the videos of our simulator included in the supplementary materials.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09439v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Local object crop collision network for efficient simulation of non-convex objects in GPU-based simulators Our goal is to develop an efficient contact detection algorithm for large-scale GPU-based simulation of non-convex objects.

{"title":"Language Models Enable Simple Systems for Generating Structured Views of Heterogeneous Data Lakes","description":"A long standing goal of the data management community is to develop general, automated systems that ingest semi-structured documents and output queryable tables without human effort or domain specific customization. Given the sheer variety of potential documents, state-of-the art systems make simplifying assumptions and use domain specific training. In this work, we ask whether we can maintain generality by using large language models (LLMs). LLMs, which are pretrained on broad data, can perform diverse downstream tasks simply conditioned on natural language task descriptions.   We propose and evaluate EVAPORATE, a simple, prototype system powered by LLMs. We identify two fundamentally different strategies for implementing this system: prompt the LLM to directly extract values from documents or prompt the LLM to synthesize code that performs the extraction. Our evaluations show a cost-quality tradeoff between these two approaches. Code synthesis is cheap, but far less accurate than directly processing each document with the LLM. To improve quality while maintaining low cost, we propose an extended code synthesis implementation, EVAPORATE-CODE+, which achieves better quality than direct extraction. Our key insight is to generate many candidate functions and ensemble their extractions using weak supervision. EVAPORATE-CODE+ not only outperforms the state-of-the art systems, but does so using a sublinear pass over the documents with the LLM. This equates to a 110x reduction in the number of tokens the LLM needs to process, averaged across 16 real-world evaluation settings of 10k documents each.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09433v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Language Models Enable Simple Systems for Generating Structured Views of Heterogeneous Data Lakes A long standing goal of the data management community is to develop general, automated systems that ingest semi-structured documents and output queryable tables without human effort or domain specific customization.

{"title":"On the Effectiveness of Image Manipulation Detection in the Age of Social Media","description":"Image manipulation detection algorithms designed to identify local anomalies often rely on the manipulated regions being ``sufficiently'' different from the rest of the non-tampered regions in the image. However, such anomalies might not be easily identifiable in high-quality manipulations, and their use is often based on the assumption that certain image phenomena are associated with the use of specific editing tools. This makes the task of manipulation detection hard in and of itself, with state-of-the-art detectors only being able to detect a limited number of manipulation types. More importantly, in cases where the anomaly assumption does not hold, the detection of false positives in otherwise non-manipulated images becomes a serious problem.   To understand the current state of manipulation detection, we present an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based and learning-free methods, assessing their performance on different benchmark datasets containing tampered and non-tampered samples. We provide a comprehensive study of their suitability for detecting different manipulations as well as their robustness when presented with non-tampered data. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based pre-processing technique that accentuates the anomalies present in manipulated regions to make them more identifiable by a variety of manipulation detection methods. To this end, we introduce an anomaly enhancement loss that, when used with a residual architecture, improves the performance of different detection algorithms with a minimal introduction of false positives on the non-manipulated data.   Lastly, we introduce an open-source manipulation detection toolkit comprising a number of standard detection algorithms.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09414v1","created":"2023-04-19","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"On the Effectiveness of Image Manipulation Detection in the Age of Social Media Image manipulation detection algorithms designed to identify local anomalies often rely on the manipulated regions being ``sufficiently'' different from the rest of the non-tampered regions in the image.

{"title":"Graph Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection for River Network Systems","description":"Water is the lifeblood of river networks, and its quality plays a crucial role in sustaining both aquatic ecosystems and human societies. Real-time monitoring of water quality is increasingly reliant on in-situ sensor technology. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying erroneous patterns in sensor data, but can be a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of the data, even under normal conditions. This paper presents a solution to the challenging task of anomaly detection for river network sensor data, which is essential for the accurate and continuous monitoring of water quality. We use a graph neural network model, the recently proposed Graph Deviation Network (GDN), which employs graph attention-based forecasting to capture the complex spatio-temporal relationships between sensors. We propose an alternate anomaly threshold criteria for the model, GDN+, based on the learned graph. To evaluate the model's efficacy, we introduce new benchmarking simulation experiments with highly-sophisticated dependency structures and subsequence anomalies of various types. We further examine the strengths and weaknesses of this baseline approach, GDN, in comparison to other benchmarking methods on complex real-world river network data. Findings suggest that GDN+ outperforms the baseline approach in high-dimensional data, while also providing improved interpretability.

{"title":"Tracking Different Ant Species: An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework and a Dataset for Multi-object Tracking","description":"Tracking individuals is a vital part of many experiments conducted to understand collective behaviour. Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable tracking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species' appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively.

Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable tracking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species' appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively.

{"title":"A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data","description":"Personal data collected at scale from surveys or digital devices offers important insights for statistical analysis and scientific research. Safely sharing such data while protecting privacy is however challenging. Anonymization allows data to be shared while minimizing privacy risks, but traditional anonymization techniques have been repeatedly shown to provide limited protection against re-identification attacks in practice. Among modern anonymization techniques, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a potential solution to find a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical utility. Synthetic data is typically generated using algorithms that learn the statistical distribution of the original records, to then generate \"artificial\" records that are structurally and statistically similar to the original ones. Yet, the fact that synthetic records are \"artificial\" does not, per se, guarantee that privacy is protected. In this work, we systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility for a wide range of synthetic data generation algorithms. Modeling privacy as protection against attribute inference attacks (AIAs), we extend and adapt linear reconstruction attacks, which have not been previously studied in the context of synthetic data. While prior work suggests that AIAs may be effective only on few outlier records, we show they can be very effective even on randomly selected records. We evaluate attacks on synthetic datasets ranging from 10^3 to 10^6 records, showing that even for the same generative model, the attack effectiveness can drastically increase when a larger number of synthetic records is generated.

Machine learning (ML) methods use this data to make high-level decisions with minimal human intervention. Data-driven predictive maintenance (PDM) is a crucial ML-based I-IoT application to find an optimal maintenance schedule for industrial assets. The performance of these ML methods can seriously be threatened by adversarial attacks where an adversary crafts perturbed data and sends it to the ML model to deteriorate its prediction performance. The models should be able to stay robust against these attacks where robustness is measured by how much perturbation in input data affects model performance. Hence, there is a need for effective defense mechanisms that can protect these models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a double defense mechanism to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in I-IoT environments. We first detect if there is an adversarial attack on a given sample using novelty detection algorithms. Then, based on the outcome of our algorithm, marking an instance as attack or normal, we select adversarial retraining or standard training to provide a secondary defense layer. If there is an attack, adversarial retraining provides a more robust model, while we apply standard training for regular samples. Since we may not know if an attack will take place, our adaptive mechanism allows us to consider irregular changes in data.

{"title":"Sequence Generation via Subsequence Similarity: Theory and Application to UAV Identification","description":"The ability to generate synthetic sequences is crucial for a wide range of applications, and recent advances in deep learning architectures and generative frameworks have greatly facilitated this process. Particularly, unconditional one-shot generative models constitute an attractive line of research that focuses on capturing the internal information of a single image, video, etc. to generate samples with similar contents. Since many of those one-shot models are shifting toward efficient non-deep and non-adversarial approaches, we examine the versatility of a one-shot generative model for augmenting whole datasets.

{"title":"On the Vulnerability of Backdoor Defenses for Federated Learning","description":"Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables jointly training a global model without sharing clients' data. However, its repetitive server-client communication gives room for backdoor attacks with aim to mislead the global model into a targeted misprediction when a specific trigger pattern is presented. In response to such backdoor threats on federated learning, various defense measures have been proposed. In this paper, we study whether the current defense mechanisms truly neutralize the backdoor threats from federated learning in a practical setting by proposing a new federated backdoor attack method for possible countermeasures. Different from traditional training (on triggered data) and rescaling (the malicious client model) based backdoor injection, the proposed backdoor attack framework (1) directly modifies (a small proportion of) local model weights to inject the backdoor trigger via sign flips; (2) jointly optimize the trigger pattern with the client model, thus is more persistent and stealthy for circumventing existing defenses.

{"title":"Graph Topology Learning Under Privacy Constraints","description":"Graph learning, which aims to infer the underlying topology behind high dimension data, has attracted intense attention. In this study, we shed a new light on graph learning by considering a pragmatic scenario where data are privacy sensitive and located in separated clients (devices or organizations). The main difficulty in learning graphs in this scenario is that we cannot process all the data in a central server, because the data are not allowed to leave the local clients due to privacy concerns. The problem becomes more challenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is unreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each client and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion. Specifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central server in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis shows that the algorithm enjoys $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. To further enhance privacy, we design a deferentially privacy algorithm to prevent the information of the raw data from being leaked when transferring model updates. A theoretical guidance is provided on how to ensure that the algorithm satisfies differential privacy. We also analyze the impact of differential privacy on the convergence of our algorithm.

{"title":"Open SESAME: Fighting Botnets with Seed Reconstructions of Domain Generation Algorithms","description":"An important aspect of many botnets is their capability to generate pseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber criminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing rendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of domains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups of domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very little manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to manually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds.

{"title":"Enhancement attacks in biomedical machine learning","description":"The prevalence of machine learning in biomedical research is rapidly growing, yet the trustworthiness of such research is often overlooked. While some previous works have investigated the ability of adversarial attacks to degrade model performance in medical imaging, the ability to falsely improve performance via recently-developed \"enhancement attacks\" may be a greater threat to biomedical machine learning. In the spirit of developing attacks to better understand trustworthiness, we developed three techniques to drastically enhance prediction performance of classifiers with minimal changes to features, including the enhancement of 1) within-dataset predictions, 2) a particular method over another, and 3) cross-dataset generalization. Our within-dataset enhancement framework falsely improved classifiers' accuracy from 50% to almost 100% while maintaining high feature similarities between original and enhanced data (Pearson's r's>0.99). Similarly, the method-specific enhancement framework was effective in falsely improving the performance of one method over another. For example, a simple neural network outperformed LR by 50% on our enhanced dataset, although no performance differences were present in the original dataset. Crucially, the original and enhanced data were still similar (r=0.95). Finally, we demonstrated that enhancement is not specific to within-dataset predictions but can also be adapted to enhance the generalization accuracy of one dataset to another by up to 38%. Overall, our results suggest that more robust data sharing and provenance tracking pipelines are necessary to maintain data integrity in biomedical machine learning research.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01885v1","created":"2023-01-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Enhancement attacks in biomedical machine learning The prevalence of machine learning in biomedical research is rapidly growing, yet the trustworthiness of such research is often overlooked.

{"title":"PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series","description":"Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications. During the process, data sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform specific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner. The high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While meaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values to local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long shape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may potentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the privacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in privacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new privacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based patterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task performance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach by sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of original data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining tasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical correlation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long pattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack and Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect MP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via perturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP index vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding methods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01838v1","created":"2023-01-04","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"PMP: Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile against Sensitive Pattern Inference for Time Series Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for the development of data-driven services and applications.

Then it goes through the privacy and security issues inside the metaverse from data-centric, learning-centric, and human-centric points-of-view. The authors address private and secure mechanisms for privatizing sensitive data attributes and securing machine learning algorithms running in a distributed manner within the metaverse platforms. Novel visions and less-investigated methods are reviewed to help mobile network operators and metaverse service providers facilitate the realization of secure and private MaaS through different layers of the metaverse, ranging from the access layer to the social interactions among clients. Later in the article, it has been explained how the paradigm of edge computing can strengthen different aspects of the metaverse. Along with that, the challenges of using edge computing in the metaverse have been comprehensively investigated. Additionally, the paper has comprehensively investigated and analyzed 10 main challenges of MaaS platforms and thoroughly discussed how blockchain technology provides solutions for these constraints. At the final, future vision and directions, such as content-centric security and zero-trust metaverse, some blockchain's unsolved challenges are also discussed to bring further insights for the network designers in the metaverse era.","classes":{"dataset":0.1321451664,"prompteng":0.0017049408}}
{"title":"Random forests, sound symbolism and Pokemon evolution","description":"This study constructs machine learning algorithms that are trained to classify samples using sound symbolism, and then it reports on an experiment designed to measure their understanding against human participants. Random forests are trained using the names of Pokemon, which are fictional video game characters, and their evolutionary status. Pokemon undergo evolution when certain in-game conditions are met. Evolution changes the appearance, abilities, and names of Pokemon. In the first experiment, we train three random forests using the sounds that make up the names of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Pokemon to classify Pokemon into pre-evolution and post-evolution categories. We then train a fourth random forest using the results of an elicitation experiment whereby Japanese participants named previously unseen Pokemon. In Experiment 2, we reproduce those random forests with name length as a feature and compare the performance of the random forests against humans in a classification experiment whereby Japanese participants classified the names elicited in Experiment 1 into pre-and post-evolution categories. Experiment 2 reveals an issue pertaining to overfitting in Experiment 1 which we resolve using a novel cross-validation method. The results show that the random forests are efficient learners of systematic sound-meaning correspondence patterns and can classify samples with greater accuracy than the human participants.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01948v1","created":"2023-01-05","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Random forests, sound symbolism and Pokemon evolution This study constructs machine learning algorithms that are trained to classify samples using sound symbolism, and then it reports on an experiment designed to measure their understanding against human participants.

{"title":"Efficient Exploration in Resource-Restricted Reinforcement Learning","description":"In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), performing actions requires consuming certain types of resources that are non-replenishable in each episode.

The major reason is that, they tend to exhaust resources fast and thus the subsequent exploration is severely restricted due to the absence of resources. To address this challenge, we first formalize the aforementioned problem as a resource-restricted reinforcement learning, and then propose a novel resource-aware exploration bonus (RAEB) to make reasonable usage of resources. An appealing feature of RAEB is that, it can significantly reduce unnecessary resource-consuming trials while effectively encouraging the agent to explore unvisited states.

We evaluate our method on benchmark game-playing environments and show that we can significantly improve game performance and generalization capability compared to other approaches, using annotated datasets equivalent to only $12$ minutes of gameplay.

{"title":"Attribute Inference Attacks in Online Multiplayer Video Games: a Case Study on Dota2","description":"Did you know that over 70 million of Dota2 players have their in-game data freely accessible? What if such data is used in malicious ways? This paper is the first to investigate such a problem.   Motivated by the widespread popularity of video games, we propose the first threat model for Attribute Inference Attacks (AIA) in the Dota2 context. We explain how (and why) attackers can exploit the abundant public data in the Dota2 ecosystem to infer private information about its players. Due to lack of concrete evidence on the efficacy of our AIA, we empirically prove and assess their impact in reality.

{"title":"Online Policy Optimization for Robust MDP","description":"Reinforcement learning (RL) has exceeded human performance in many synthetic settings such as video games and Go. However, real-world deployment of end-to-end RL models is less common, as RL models can be very sensitive to slight perturbation of the environment. The robust Markov decision process (MDP) framework -- in which the transition probabilities belong to an uncertainty set around a nominal model -- provides one way to develop robust models. While previous analysis shows RL algorithms are effective assuming access to a generative model, it remains unclear whether RL can be efficient under a more realistic online setting, which requires a careful balance between exploration and exploitation. In this work, we consider online robust MDP by interacting with an unknown nominal system. We propose a robust optimistic policy optimization algorithm that is provably efficient. To address the additional uncertainty caused by an adversarial environment, our model features a new optimistic update rule derived via Fenchel conjugates.

{"title":"Automatic Testing and Validation of Level of Detail Reductions Through Supervised Learning","description":"Modern video games are rapidly growing in size and scale, and to create rich and interesting environments, a large amount of content is needed. As a consequence, often several thousands of detailed 3D assets are used to create a single scene. As each asset's polygon mesh can contain millions of polygons, the number of polygons that need to be drawn every frame may exceed several billions. Therefore, the computational resources often limit how many detailed objects that can be displayed in a scene. To push this limit and to optimize performance one can reduce the polygon count of the assets when possible. Basically, the idea is that an object at farther distance from the capturing camera, consequently with relatively smaller screen size, its polygon count may be reduced without affecting the perceived quality. Level of Detail (LOD) refers to the complexity level of a 3D model representation. The process of removing complexity is often called LOD reduction and can be done automatically with an algorithm or by hand by artists. However, this process may lead to deterioration of the visual quality if the different LODs differ significantly, or if LOD reduction transition is not seamless. Today the validation of these results is mainly done manually requiring an expert to visually inspect the results. However, this process is slow, mundane, and therefore prone to error. Herein we propose a method to automate this process based on the use of deep convolutional networks.

Deep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world.

On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture the complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the resulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm has recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction by planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement learning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of potential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial and error needed in the real environment. However, it is unknown whether Dreamer can facilitate faster learning on physical robots. In this paper, we apply Dreamer to 4 robots to learn online and directly in the real world, without simulators. Dreamer trains a quadruped robot to roll off its back, stand up, and walk from scratch and without resets in only 1 hour. We then push the robot and find that Dreamer adapts within 10 minutes to withstand perturbations or quickly roll over and stand back up.

However, they typically learn tabula rasa in isolated environments with limited and manually conceived objectives, thus failing to generalize across a wide spectrum of tasks and capabilities.

In imitation learning, near-optimal expert data can be difficult to obtain, and even in the limit of infinite data cannot imply a total ordering over trajectories as preferences can. On the other hand, learning from preferences alone is challenging as a large number of preferences are required to infer a high-dimensional reward function, though preference data is typically much easier to collect than expert demonstrations. The classical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formulation learns from expert demonstrations but provides no mechanism to incorporate learning from offline preferences and vice versa. We instantiate the proposed ranking-game framework with a novel ranking loss giving an algorithm that can simultaneously learn from expert demonstrations and preferences, gaining the advantages of both modalities.

{"title":"Reward Relabelling for combined Reinforcement and Imitation Learning on sparse-reward tasks","description":"During recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made successful incursions into complex decision-making applications such as robotics, autonomous driving or video games. In the search for more sample-efficient algorithms, a promising direction is to leverage as much external off-policy data as possible. One staple of this data-driven approach is to learn from expert demonstrations. In the past, multiple ideas have been proposed to make good use of the demonstrations added to the replay buffer, such as pretraining on demonstrations only or minimizing additional cost functions. We present a new method, able to leverage demonstrations and episodes collected online in any sparse-reward environment with any off-policy algorithm. Our method is based on a reward bonus given to demonstrations and successful episodes, encouraging expert imitation and self-imitation. First, we give a reward bonus to the transitions coming from demonstrations to encourage the agent to match the demonstrated behaviour. Then, upon collecting a successful episode, we relabel its transitions with the same bonus before adding them to the replay buffer, encouraging the agent to also match its previous successes. Our experiments focus on manipulation robotics, specifically on three tasks for a 6 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm in simulation. We show that our method based on reward relabeling improves the performance of the base algorithm (SAC and DDPG) on these tasks, even in the absence of demonstrations. Furthermore, integrating into our method two improvements from previous works allows our approach to outperform all baselines.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03834v1","created":"2022-01-11","tags":["arxiv","ml","gaming"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND video AND games OR machine AND learning AND gaming"},"text":"Reward Relabelling for combined Reinforcement and Imitation Learning on sparse-reward tasks During recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made successful incursions into complex decision-making applications such as robotics, autonomous driving or video games.

Thus, ChatGPT threatens to corrupt rather than improves users' judgment. These findings raise the question of how to ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT and similar AI. Transparency is often touted but seems ineffective. We propose training to improve digital literacy.","classes":{"dataset":0.0248801503,"prompteng":0.05105168}}

{"title":"Modeling Label Semantics Improves Activity Recognition","description":"Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., \"open door\" and \"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\" and \"walk downstairs\". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens (\"open\", \"walk\"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution (\"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03462v1","created":"2023-01-01","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"abs:\"chatgpt\""},"text":"Modeling Label Semantics Improves Activity Recognition Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs.

{"title":"The European AI Liability Directives -- Critique of a Half-Hearted Approach and Lessons for the Future","description":"As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and beyond.   This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond.

Study of temporal variability may provide a unique way to discriminate the imprint of the inner engine activity from geometry and propagation related effects. We define the minimum variability timescale (MVT) as the shortest duration of individual pulses that shape a light curve for a sample of GRBs and test correlations with peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, and jet opening angle. We compare these correlations with predictions from recent numerical simulations for a relativistic structured -- possibly wobbling -- jet and assess the value of MTV as probe of prompt-emission physics. We used the peak detection algorithm mepsa to identify the shortest pulse within a GRB time history and estimate its full width half maximum (FWHM). We applied this framework to two sets of GRBs: Swift (from 2005 to July 2022) and Insight-HXMT (from June 2017 to July 2021, including 221009A).

{"title":"Connecting the early afterglow to the prompt GRB and the central engine in the striped jet model","description":"Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to (i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are characterized by a single length-scale.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11406v1","created":"2022-12-21","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Connecting the early afterglow to the prompt GRB and the central engine in the striped jet model Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated.

As a result, early detection of SRS conflicts is critical to project sustainability.

This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences. To increase story generation robustness we further fine-tune the contrastive reward model using a prompt-learning technique.

Such methods, however, significantly overfit the training data suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain.

The proposed loss can be interpreted in multiple ways including as a regularizer, as a means for language-based augmentation, and as a way of learning more discriminative class centroids.

In particular, we focus on the case in which the external shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smaller than the internal shock one. We find that bursts in such high density environments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode that is due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard to soft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulse light curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to go dormant for a long time before re-igniting. In addition, short GRB engines would produce bursts with prompt duration that would exceed the canonical 2 s separation threshold and would likely be incorrectly classified as long events, even though they would not be accompanied by a simultaneous supernova.

The main source of controversy is rooted in its indirect nature; the material tensile strength is inferred upon assuming that cracking initiates at the centre of the sample. Here, we use the Griffith criterion and finite element analysis to map the conditions (jaws geometry and material properties) that result in the nucleation of a centre crack. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict ourselves to evaluating the stress state at the disk centre; the failure envelope of the generalised Griffith criterion is used to establish the crack nucleation location. We find that the range of conditions where the Brazilian test is valid is much narrower than previously assumed, with current practices and standards being inappropriate for a wide range of rock-like materials. The results obtained are used to develop a protocol that experimentalists can follow to obtain a valid estimate of the material tensile strength.

{"title":"Flow network controlled shape transformation of a thin membrane through differential fluid storage and surface expansion","description":"The mechanical properties of a thin, planar material, perfused by an embedded flow network, can be changed locally and globally by the fluid transport and storage, resulting in small or large-scale deformation, such as out-of-plane buckling. Fluid absorption and storage eventually cause the material to locally swell. Different parts can hydrate and swell unevenly, prompting a differential expansion of the surface. In order to computationally study the hydraulically induced differential swelling and buckling of such a membrane, we develop a network model that describes both the membrane shape and fluid movement, coupling mechanics with hydrodynamics. We simulate the time-dependent fluid distribution in the flow network based on a spatially explicit resistor network model with local fluid-storage capacitance. The shape of the surface is modeled by a spring network produced by a tethered mesh discretization, in which local bond rest lengths are adjusted instantaneously according to associated local fluid content in the capacitors in a quasi-static way. We investigate the effects of various designs of the flow network, including overall hydraulic traits (resistance and capacitance) and hierarchical architecture (arrangement of major and minor veins), on the specific dynamics of membrane shape transformation. To quantify these effects, we explore the correlation between local Gaussian curvature and relative stored fluid content in each hierarchy by using linear regression, which reveals that stronger correlations could be induced by less densely connected major veins. This flow-controlled mechanism of shape transformation was inspired by the blooming of flowers through the unfolding of petals. It can potentially offer insights for other reversible motions observed in plants induced by differential turgor and water transport through the xylem vessels, as well as engineering applications.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04575v1","created":"2022-09-10","tags":["arxiv","ml","prompteng"],"meta":{"query":"prompt AND engineering"},"text":"Flow network controlled shape transformation of a thin membrane through differential fluid storage and surface expansion The mechanical properties of a thin, planar material, perfused by an embedded flow network, can be changed locally and globally by the fluid transport and storage, resulting in small or large-scale deformation, such as out-of-plane buckling.

Nevertheless, one of the most challenging aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an alternative solution.

Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these events.

Using cross-lingual understanding and Natural Language Inference, it is possible to train models whose applications extend beyond the training language. We can leverage the power of machine translation to skip the tiresome part of translating datasets from one language to another. In this work, we focus on improving the original XNLI dataset by re-translating the MNLI dataset in all of the 14 different languages present in XNLI, including the test and dev sets of XNLI using Google Translate.

The created synthetic datasets may be used for various tasks including motor type classification, object detection for decentralized material transfer tasks, part segmentation for disassembly and handling tasks, or even reinforcement learning-based robotics control or view-planning.","classes":{"dataset":0.0177099165,"prompteng":0.0103026694}}
{"title":"Order-Preserving Database Encryption with Secret Sharing","description":"The order-preserving encryption (OPE) problem was initially formulated by the database community in 2004 soon after the paradigm database-as-a-service (DaaS) was coined in 2002. Over the past two decades, OPE has drawn tremendous research interest from communities of databases, cryptography, and security; we have witnessed significant advances in OPE schemes both theoretically and systematically. All existing OPE schemes assume that the outsourced database is modeled as a single semi-honest adversary who should learn nothing more than the order information of plaintext messages up to a negligible probability. This paper addresses the OPE problem from a new perspective: instead of modeling the outsourced database as a single semi-honest adversary, we assume the outsourced database \\textit{service} compromises a cluster of non-colluding servers, which is a practical assumption as all major cloud vendors support multiple database instances deployed to exclusive sub-networks or even to distinct data centers. This assumption allows us to design a new stateless OPE protocol, namely order-preserving database encryption with secret sharing (ODES), by employing secret-sharing schemes among those presumably non-colluding servers.

{"title":"Predictions of photophysical properties of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes based on ensemble machine learning approach","description":"Phosphorescent metal complexes have been under intense investigations as emissive dopants for energy efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among them, cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes are widespread triplet emitters with color-tunable emissions. To render their practical applications as OLED emitters, it is in great need to develop Pt(II) complexes with high radiative decay rate constant ($k_r$) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield. Thus, an efficient and accurate prediction tool is highly desirable. Here, we develop a general protocol for accurate predictions of emission wavelength, radiative decay rate constant, and PL quantum yield for phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters based on the combination of first-principles quantum mechanical method, machine learning (ML) and experimental calibration. A new dataset concerning phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters is constructed, with more than two hundred samples collected from the literature. Features containing pertinent electronic properties of the complexes are chosen. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning models combined with stacking-based approaches exhibit the best performance, where the values of squared correlation coefficients ($R^2$), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.96, 7.21 nm and 13.00 nm for emission wavelength prediction, and 0.81, 0.11 and 0.15 for PL quantum yield prediction. For radiative decay rate constant ($k_r$), the obtained value of $R^2$ is 0.67 while MAE and RMSE are 0.21 and 0.25 (both in log scale), respectively. The accuracy of the protocol is further confirmed using 24 recently reported Pt(II) complexes, which demonstrates its reliability for a broad palette of Pt(II) emitters.We expect this protocol will become a valuable tool, accelerating the rational design of novel OLED materials with desired properties.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05639v1","created":"2023-01-08","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Predictions of photophysical properties of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes based on ensemble machine learning approach Phosphorescent metal complexes have been under intense investigations as emissive dopants for energy efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).

Near-miss is one type of accident and can be defined as a narrowly avoided accident.

Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by incorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the underlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to align the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and centroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source images.

{"title":"Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests for missing value imputation in high-dimensional datasets","description":"Missing values are a common problem in data science and machine learning. Removing instances with missing values can adversely affect the quality of further data analysis. This is exacerbated when there are relatively many more features than instances, and thus the proportion of affected instances is high. Such a scenario is common in many important domains, for example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets provide a large number of features over a genome for a relatively small number of individuals. To preserve as much information as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is acutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for imputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases to be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this paper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification problem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests. Using multi-label Random Forests instead of neural networks works well for low-sampled data as there are fewer parameters to optimize. Experiments on several SNP datasets show that our algorithm effectively imputes missing values based only on information from the dataset and exhibits better performance than standard algorithms that do not require any additional information.

{"title":"Evaluating Generalizability of Deep Learning Models Using Indian-COVID-19 CT Dataset","description":"Computer tomography (CT) have been routinely used for the diagnosis of lung diseases and recently, during the pandemic, for detecting the infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease. One of the major concerns in using ma-chine learning (ML) approaches for automatic processing of CT scan images in clinical setting is that these methods are trained on limited and biased sub-sets of publicly available COVID-19 data. This has raised concerns regarding the generalizability of these models on external datasets, not seen by the model during training. To address some of these issues, in this work CT scan images from confirmed COVID-19 data obtained from one of the largest public repositories, COVIDx CT 2A were used for training and internal vali-dation of machine learning models. For the external validation we generated Indian-COVID-19 CT dataset, an open-source repository containing 3D CT volumes and 12096 chest CT images from 288 COVID-19 patients from In-dia. Comparative performance evaluation of four state-of-the-art machine learning models, viz., a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), and three other CNN based deep learning (DL) models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 in classifying CT images into three classes, viz., normal, non-covid pneumonia, and COVID-19 is carried out on these two datasets.

{"title":"A Novel Dataset and a Deep Learning Method for Mitosis Nuclei Segmentation and Classification","description":"Mitosis nuclei count is one of the important indicators for the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer. The manual annotation needs experienced pathologists, which is very time-consuming and inefficient. With the development of deep learning methods, some models with good performance have emerged, but the generalization ability should be further strengthened. In this paper, we propose a two-stage mitosis segmentation and classification method, named SCMitosis. Firstly, the segmentation performance with a high recall rate is achieved by the proposed depthwise separable convolution residual block and channel-spatial attention gate. Then, a classification network is cascaded to further improve the detection performance of mitosis nuclei. The proposed model is verified on the ICPR 2012 dataset, and the highest F-score value of 0.8687 is obtained compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

This new challenge involves a new dataset and metrics indicating solution performance when damage is more local and limited than in xBD. Our challenge measures a network's ability to identify individual buildings and their damage level without excessive reliance on the buildings' surroundings. Methods that succeed on this challenge will provide more fine-grained, precise damage information than original xView2 solutions. The best-performing xView2 networks' performances dropped noticeably in our new limited/local damage detection task. The common causes of failure observed are that (1) building objects and their classifications are not separated well, and (2) when they are, the classification is strongly biased by surrounding buildings and other damage context.

We evaluate the power of this approach by fine-tuning the open source UL2 language model on a subset of the dataset, extracting a set of implication relations from a corpus of product buying guides, and conducting human evaluations of the resulting predictions.","classes":{"dataset":0.9502724409,"prompteng":0.0100109093}}

{"title":"Quirk or Palmer: A Comparative Study of Modal Verb Frameworks with Annotated Datasets","description":"Modal verbs, such as \"can\", \"may\", and \"must\", are commonly used in daily communication to convey the speaker's perspective related to the likelihood and/or mode of the proposition.

This lack of agreement stems from high degrees of flexibility and polysemy from the modal verbs, making it more difficult for researchers to incorporate insights from this family of words into their work.

To demonstrate the efficacy of CHAD for training and evaluation, we benchmark two state-of-the-art skeleton-based anomaly detection algorithms on CHAD and provide comprehensive analysis, including both quantitative results and qualitative examination.","classes":{"dataset":0.101957649,"prompteng":0.0357852541}}

However, recommender systems often face more challenging fairness issues for new users or cold-start users due to their insufficient amount of interactions. Therefore, it is essential to study whether the trained model still performs fairly for a new set of cold-start users. This paper considers the scenario where the recommender system meets new users who only have limited or even no interaction with the platform, and aims at providing high-quality and fair recommendations to such users effectively. The sufficient interaction data from warm users is treated as the source user domain, while the data from new users is treated as the target user domain, and we consider to transfer the counterfactual fairness from the source users to the target users.

{"title":"In-situ Water quality monitoring in Oil and Gas operations","description":"From agriculture to mining, to energy, surface water quality monitoring is an essential task. As oil and gas operators work to reduce the consumption of freshwater, it is increasingly important to actively manage fresh and non-fresh water resources over the long term. For large-scale monitoring, manual sampling at many sites has become too time-consuming and unsustainable, given the sheer number of dispersed ponds, small lakes, playas, and wetlands over a large area. Therefore, satellite-based environmental monitoring presents great potential. Many existing satellite-based monitoring studies utilize index-based methods to monitor large water bodies such as rivers and oceans. However, these existing methods fail when monitoring small ponds-the reflectance signal received from small water bodies is too weak to detect. To address this challenge, we propose a new Water Quality Enhanced Index (WQEI) Model, which is designed to enable users to determine contamination levels in water bodies with weak reflectance patterns. Our results show that 1) WQEI is a good indicator of water turbidity validated with 1200 water samples measured in the laboratory, and 2) by applying our method to commonly available satellite data (e.g. LandSat8), one can achieve high accuracy water quality monitoring efficiently in large regions.

{"title":"An Asynchronous Intensity Representation for Framed and Event Video Sources","description":"Neuromorphic \"event\" cameras, designed to mimic the human vision system with asynchronous sensing, unlock a new realm of high-speed and high dynamic range applications. However, researchers often either revert to a framed representation of event data for applications, or build bespoke applications for a particular camera's event data type. To usher in the next era of video systems, accommodate new event camera designs, and explore the benefits to asynchronous video in classical applications, we argue that there is a need for an asynchronous, source-agnostic video representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel, asynchronous intensity representation for both framed and non-framed data sources. We show that our representation can increase intensity precision and greatly reduce the number of samples per pixel compared to grid-based representations. With framed sources, we demonstrate that by permitting a small amount of loss through the temporal averaging of similar pixel values, we can reduce our representational sample rate by more than half, while incurring a drop in VMAF quality score of only 4.5.

{"title":"Characterising fast-time variations in the hard X-ray time profiles of solar flares using Solar Orbiter's STIX","description":"Aims: The aim of this work is to develop a method to systematically detect and characterise fast-time variations ($\\gtrsim 1$s) in the non-thermal hard X-ray (HXR) time profiles of solar flares using high-resolution data from Solar Orbiter's Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX).   Methods: The HXR time profiles were smoothed using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. The time profiles were then fitted with a linear combination of Gaussians to decompose the time profile. From the Gaussian decomposition, key characteristics such as the periodicity, full width at half maximum (FWHM), time evolution, and amplitude can be derived.   Results: We present the outcome of applying this method to four M and X GOES-class flares from the first year of Solar Orbiter science operations. The HXR time profiles of these flares were decomposed into individual Gaussians and their periods were derived. The quality of fit is quantified by the standard deviation of the residuals (difference between observed and fitted curve, normalised by the error on the observed data), for which we obtain $\\leq 1.8$ for all flares presented.

Based on these results, we recommend that analysts assimilate radial velocities directly, and avoid pre-gridding prior to analysis.","classes":{"dataset":0.0136636142,"prompteng":0.0244559217}}

{"title":"Cross-domain Unsupervised Reconstruction with Equivariance for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography","description":"Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground truth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and performance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access more measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction (CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach exploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller number of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a model-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce the measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data, by randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high proportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in both image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo solution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with minimum error of the image.

However, these methods often fail to provide visually coherent details or require additional setups. For example, the commercial framework ARKit uses a convolutional neural network that can generate realistic environment maps; however the corresponding reflective rendering might not match the physical environments. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a lighting reconstruction framework called LitAR that enables realistic and visually-coherent rendering. LitAR addresses several challenges of supporting lighting information for mobile AR. First, to address the spatial variance problem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting reconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction and the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding environment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second, LitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality, namely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing. Third, to handle the mismatch between the mobile computation capability and the high computation requirement of lighting reconstruction, LitAR employs two novel real-time environment map rendering techniques called multi-resolution projection and anchor extrapolation. These two techniques effectively remove the need of time-consuming mesh reconstruction while maintaining visual quality.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06184v1","created":"2023-01-15","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"LitAR: Visually Coherent Lighting for Mobile Augmented Reality An accurate understanding of omnidirectional environment lighting is crucial for high-quality virtual object rendering in mobile augmented reality (AR).

First, to address the spatial variance problem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting reconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction and the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding environment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second, LitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality, namely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing. Third, to handle the mismatch between the mobile computation capability and the high computation requirement of lighting reconstruction, LitAR employs two novel real-time environment map rendering techniques called multi-resolution projection and anchor extrapolation. These two techniques effectively remove the need of time-consuming mesh reconstruction while maintaining visual quality.","classes":{"dataset":0.2412023246,"prompteng":0.0106246164}}

{"title":"NCP: Neural Correspondence Prior for Effective Unsupervised Shape Matching","description":"We present Neural Correspondence Prior (NCP), a new paradigm for computing correspondences between 3D shapes. Our approach is fully unsupervised and can lead to high-quality correspondences even in challenging cases such as sparse point clouds or non-isometric meshes, where current methods fail. Our first key observation is that, in line with neural priors observed in other domains, recent network architectures on 3D data, even without training, tend to produce pointwise features that induce plausible maps between rigid or non-rigid shapes. Secondly, we show that given a noisy map as input, training a feature extraction network with the input map as supervision tends to remove artifacts from the input and can act as a powerful correspondence denoising mechanism, both between individual pairs and within a collection. With these observations in hand, we propose a two-stage unsupervised paradigm for shape matching by (i) performing unsupervised training by adapting an existing approach to obtain an initial set of noisy matches, and (ii) using these matches to train a network in a supervised manner.

{"title":"Understanding Concept Identification as Consistent Data Clustering Across Multiple Feature Spaces","description":"Identifying meaningful concepts in large data sets can provide valuable insights into engineering design problems. Concept identification aims at identifying non-overlapping groups of design instances that are similar in a joint space of all features, but which are also similar when considering only subsets of features. These subsets usually comprise features that characterize a design with respect to one specific context, for example, constructive design parameters, performance values, or operation modes. It is desirable to evaluate the quality of design concepts by considering several of these feature subsets in isolation. In particular, meaningful concepts should not only identify dense, well separated groups of data instances, but also provide non-overlapping groups of data that persist when considering pre-defined feature subsets separately. In this work, we propose to view concept identification as a special form of clustering algorithm with a broad range of potential applications beyond engineering design. To illustrate the differences between concept identification and classical clustering algorithms, we apply a recently proposed concept identification algorithm to two synthetic data sets and show the differences in identified solutions. In addition, we introduce the mutual information measure as a metric to evaluate whether solutions return consistent clusters across relevant subsets. To support the novel understanding of concept identification, we consider a simulated data set from a decision-making problem in the energy management domain and show that the identified clusters are more interpretable with respect to relevant feature subsets than clusters found by common clustering algorithms and are thus more suitable to support a decision maker.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05525v1","created":"2023-01-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Understanding Concept Identification as Consistent Data Clustering Across Multiple Feature Spaces Identifying meaningful concepts in large data sets can provide valuable insights into engineering design problems.

In this work, we present an algorithm to detect active devices for unsourced random access, i.e., the devices are uncoordinated. The devices use a unique, but non-orthogonal preamble, known to the network, prior to sending the payload data. They do not employ any carrier sensing technique and blindly transmit the preamble and data. To detect the active users, we exploit partial channel state information (CSI), which could have been obtained through a previous channel estimate. For static devices, e.g., Internet of Things nodes, it is shown that CSI is less time-variant than assumed in many theoretical works. The presented iterative algorithm uses a maximum likelihood approach to estimate both the activity and a potential phase offset of each known device. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is evaluated.

The devices use a unique, but non-orthogonal preamble, known to the network, prior to sending the payload data. They do not employ any carrier sensing technique and blindly transmit the preamble and data. To detect the active users, we exploit partial channel state information (CSI), which could have been obtained through a previous channel estimate. For static devices, e.g., Internet of Things nodes, it is shown that CSI is less time-variant than assumed in many theoretical works. The presented iterative algorithm uses a maximum likelihood approach to estimate both the activity and a potential phase offset of each known device. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is evaluated. The performance in terms of probability of miss detection and false alarm is assessed for different qualities of partial CSI and different signal-to-noise ratio.","classes":{"dataset":0.1828601211,"prompteng":0.1085278913}}

Missing regions in urban data can be caused by sensor or software failures, data quality issues, interference from weather events, incomplete data collection, or varying data use regulations; any missing data can render the entire dataset unusable for downstream applications. To ensure coverage and utility, we adapt computer vision techniques for image inpainting to operate on 3D histograms (2D space + 1D time) commonly used for data exchange in urban settings.   Adapting these techniques to the spatiotemporal setting requires handling skew: urban data tend to follow population density patterns (small dense regions surrounded by large sparse areas); these patterns can dominate the learning process and fool the model into ignoring local or transient effects. To combat skew, we 1) train simultaneously in space and time, and 2) focus attention on dense regions by biasing the masks used for training to the skew in the data. We evaluate the core model and these two extensions using the NYC taxi data and the NYC bikeshare data, simulating different conditions for missing data. We show that the core model is effective qualitatively and quantitatively, and that biased masking during training reduces error in a variety of scenarios.

Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with subsets of clients, hoping to increase the accuracy or let future FL rounds retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.   We design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's {\\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client responsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neurons activations to determine the precise client deviating from normal behavior. FedDebug achieves 100\\% to find a single client and 90.3\\% accuracy to find multiple faulty clients.

First, FedDebug enables interactive debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's {\\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model) and seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client responsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neurons activations to determine the precise client deviating from normal behavior. FedDebug achieves 100\\% to find a single client and 90.3\\% accuracy to find multiple faulty clients. FedDebug's interactive debugging incurs 1.2\\% overhead during training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1\\% of a round's training time. With FedDebug, we bring effective debugging practices to federated learning, improving the quality and productivity of FL application developers.","classes":{"dataset":0.0842037201,"prompteng":0.0060193981}}

CiT contains two loops: an outer loop curating the training data and an inner loop consuming the curated training data. The text encoder connects the two loops. Given metadata for tasks of interest, e.g., class names, and a large pool of image-text pairs, CiT alternatively selects relevant training data from the pool by measuring the similarity of their text embeddings and embeddings of the metadata.

CiT automatically yields quality data to speed-up contrastive image-text training and alleviates the need for an offline data filtering pipeline, allowing broad data sources (including raw image-text pairs from the web). CiT contains two loops: an outer loop curating the training data and an inner loop consuming the curated training data. The text encoder connects the two loops. Given metadata for tasks of interest, e.g., class names, and a large pool of image-text pairs, CiT alternatively selects relevant training data from the pool by measuring the similarity of their text embeddings and embeddings of the metadata. In our experiments, we observe that CiT can speed up training by over an order of magnitude, especially if the raw data size is large.","classes":{"dataset":0.4000890255,"prompteng":0.0853734612}}
{"title":"Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers","description":"We introduce a language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). Specifically, we train a neural codec language model (called Vall-E) using discrete codes derived from an off-the-shelf neural audio codec model, and regard TTS as a conditional language modeling task rather than continuous signal regression as in previous work. During the pre-training stage, we scale up the TTS training data to 60K hours of English speech which is hundreds of times larger than existing systems. Vall-E emerges in-context learning capabilities and can be used to synthesize high-quality personalized speech with only a 3-second enrolled recording of an unseen speaker as an acoustic prompt. Experiment results show that Vall-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system in terms of speech naturalness and speaker similarity.

The monitoring of forest health is, therefore, indispensable for the long-term conservation of forests and their sustainable management.

Apparently, remote sensing-based machine learning techniques have proven to be more efficient and sustainable with unprecedented accuracy in forest inventory. However, the application of these techniques is still in its infancy with respect to dead wood mapping. This study investigates for the first time the automatic classification of individual coniferous trees into five decay stages (live, declining, dead, loose bark, and clean) from combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds and CIR images using three Machine Learning methods - 3D point cloud-based deep learning (PointNet), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Random Forest (RF). All models achieved promising results, reaching overall accuracy (OA) up to 90.9%, 90.6%, and 80.6% for CNN, RF, and PointNet, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the image-based approach notably outperformed the 3D point cloud-based one, while spectral image texture is of the highest relevance to the success of categorizing tree decay. Our models could therefore be used for automatic determination of single tree decay stages and landscape-wide assessment of dead wood amount and quality using modern airborne remote sensing techniques with machine/deep learning.

{"title":"Quantum relaxation for quadratic programs over orthogonal matrices","description":"Quadratic programming over the (special) orthogonal group encompasses a broad class of optimization problems such as group synchronization, point-set registration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural generalization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary decision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we establish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group onto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying orthogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements, which we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the theory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the derived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the quadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous to classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When optimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential in matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution into the feasible space, we employ rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from appropriate measurements of the quantum state.

However, we observe that two drawbacks of the positive and negative sample construction mechanisms limit the performance of existing algorithms from further improvement. 1) The quality of positive samples heavily depends on the carefully designed data augmentations, while inappropriate data augmentations would easily lead to the semantic drift and indiscriminative positive samples. 2) The constructed negative samples are not reliable for ignoring important clustering information. To solve these problems, we propose a Cluster-guided Contrastive deep Graph Clustering network (CCGC) by mining the intrinsic supervision information in the high-confidence clustering results. Specifically, instead of conducting complex node or edge perturbation, we construct two views of the graph by designing special Siamese encoders whose weights are not shared between the sibling sub-networks. Then, guided by the high-confidence clustering information, we carefully select and construct the positive samples from the same high-confidence cluster in two views. Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we regard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples, thus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed sample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples from the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by maximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and negative samples. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCGC compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01098v1","created":"2023-01-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Cluster-guided Contrastive Graph Clustering Network Benefiting from the intrinsic supervision information exploitation capability, contrastive learning has achieved promising performance in the field of deep graph clustering recently.

Then, guided by the high-confidence clustering information, we carefully select and construct the positive samples from the same high-confidence cluster in two views. Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we regard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples, thus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed sample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples from the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by maximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and negative samples. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCGC compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","classes":{"dataset":0.3643198013,"prompteng":0.0047921967}}
{"title":"Dissecting Continual Learning a Structural and Data Analysis","description":"Continual Learning (CL) is a field dedicated to devise algorithms able to achieve lifelong learning. Overcoming the knowledge disruption of previously acquired concepts, a drawback affecting deep learning models and that goes by the name of catastrophic forgetting, is a hard challenge. Currently, deep learning methods can attain impressive results when the data modeled does not undergo a considerable distributional shift in subsequent learning sessions, but whenever we expose such systems to this incremental setting, performance drop very quickly. Overcoming this limitation is fundamental as it would allow us to build truly intelligent systems showing stability and plasticity. Secondly, it would allow us to overcome the onerous limitation of retraining these architectures from scratch with the new updated data. In this thesis, we tackle the problem from multiple directions. In a first study, we show that in rehearsal-based techniques (systems that use memory buffer), the quantity of data stored in the rehearsal buffer is a more important factor over the quality of the data. Secondly, we propose one of the early works of incremental learning on ViTs architectures, comparing functional, weight and attention regularization approaches and propose effective novel a novel asymmetric loss. At the end we conclude with a study on pretraining and how it affects the performance in Continual Learning, raising some questions about the effective progression of the field. We then conclude with some future directions and closing remarks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01033v1","created":"2023-01-03","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Dissecting Continual Learning a Structural and Data Analysis Continual Learning (CL) is a field dedicated to devise algorithms able to achieve lifelong learning.

{"title":"Bias Correction of Operational Storm Surge Forecasts Using Neural Networks","description":"Storm surges can give rise to extreme floods in coastal areas. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) produces 120-hour regional operational storm surge forecasts along the coast of Norway based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), using a model setup called Nordic4-SS. Despite advances in the development of models and computational capabilities, forecast errors remain large enough to impact response measures and issued alerts, in particular, during the strongest storm events. Reducing these errors will positively impact the efficiency of the warning systems while minimizing efforts and resources spent on mitigation. Here, we investigate how forecasts can be improved with residual learning, i.e., training data-driven models to predict the residuals in forecasts from Nordic4-SS. A simple error mapping technique and a more sophisticated Neural Network (NN) method are tested. Using the NN residual correction method, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in the Oslo Fjord is reduced by 36% for lead times of one hour and 9% for 24 hours. Therefore, the residual NN method is a promising direction for correcting storm surge forecasts, especially on short timescales. Moreover, it is well adapted to being deployed operationally, as i) the correction is applied on top of the existing model and requires no changes to it, ii) all predictors used for NN inference are already available operationally, iii) prediction by the NNs is very fast, typically a few seconds per station, and iv) the NN correction can be provided to a human expert who may inspect it, compare it with the model output, and see how much correction is brought by the NN, allowing to capitalize on human expertise as a quality validation of the NN output.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00892v2","created":"2023-01-02","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Bias Correction of Operational Storm Surge Forecasts Using Neural Networks Storm surges can give rise to extreme floods in coastal areas.

{"title":"Credible Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Evidential Fusion on Aerial-Ground Dual-view Images","description":"Due to their ability to offer more comprehensive information than data from a single view, multi-view (multi-source, multi-modal, multi-perspective, etc.) data are being used more frequently in remote sensing tasks. However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality becomes more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible. On two well-known, publicly available datasets of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing images, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

However, it seems that to have a chance at getting accepted at top conferences, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc, reviewers are looking at results on ImageNet2012.\n\nThe problem being, my university does not have a lot of resources available. Granted, we have 2 40GB A100 GPUs available, but these are shared within the entire university. From my estimate, using both A100 GPUs will allow us to use a batch size around 256 when testing our final model, containing 22 million parameters, at a max image size of 300.

Unlike many techniques for extractive summaries, TextReducer has the option for a \"target\" around which the summary will be focused. This target can be any text prompt, meaning that a user can specify the type of information that they would like to find or summarize, and ignore everything else.\n\nAnother key benefits of TextReducer is that rather than extracting the sentences for the summary, it carves away at the original text, removing unnecessary sentences. This leads to more fluent summarizations, and preserves grammatical features like coreference that are often lost in traditional extractive summarization.\n\nFor instance, in the sentences \"In his free time, John enjoyed playing golf and traveling with his family. He was married with two children, and lived in a suburban area with his wife and kids.\", it is imporant that these sentences stay linked together. Otherwise, the coreferent of the word \"He\" in the second sentence is lost. TextReducer is much better at preserving such related sentences, and is thus a valuable tool for fast, but fluent summarizations of large texts.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/10kys25/targeted_summarization_a_tool_for_information/","created":"2023-01-25","tags":["languagetechnology","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2},"text":"Targeted Summarization - A tool for information extraction &amp;#x200B;\n\n[Visual of the Algorithm](https://reddit.com/link/10kys25/video/dci8r3ovz6ea1/player)\n\nHere's the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization](https://github.com/helliun/targetedSummarization)\n\nTextReducer is a tool for summarization and information extraction powered by the SentenceTransformer library.

The Pok\u00e9mon universe serves as an ideal testing ground, since its battle system is a well-defined environment (match-ups, weather / status conditions) and follows a closed world assumption. \n\nTo audit ChatGPT, we introduce a staged conversational framework (protocol): (a) Audit Knowledge, (b) Use of knowledge in context, and (c) Introduction of new knowledge, in 3 settings of human-in-the-loop interaction: neutral \ud83e\udd14, cooperative \ud83e\udd17, and adversarial \ud83d\ude08.\n\nWe present a series of well-defined battles starting from simpler to more complex scenarios involving level imbalance, weather and/or status conditions.

{"title":"[Discussion] Searching for end-to-end MLOps training solution","description":"I am working in a small research group and we recently found a problem with our resource utilization. We have 11 servers with 4 gpus in each and I am looking for an automatic execution manager with a queue. Currently we don't have anything in place and just write in a table which GPU is occupied by who, which, as you can imagine, is not ideal, our current utilization is around 50-60%. So we came up with the following two requirements:\n\n* Queue for training/inference tasks with dynamic GPU allocation (ex. you can launch 4 tasks on one machine that require 1 GPU each, or 2 tasks with 2 GPU, etc.)\n* Ability to reserve GPUs so that you can connect to the host and work directly (for example you want to launch 3rd party repository with complex environment setup)\n\nThe only solution I found so far is ClearML with clearml agent, but there are two problems with it, the first one is dynamic GPU allocation is available only in enterprise edition, which means that we need to reserve some hosts to run 2 GPU tasks and some that run 1 GPU tasks, which is not ideal. The second is that you can't directly tell clearml to not use some gpu for the time, so we used a crutch - launch an task with infinite loop in it that does nothing, which is once again is not ideal.\n\nHave some of you encountered a similar problems? How did you solve it? Maybe there is a solution that we missed, any help is appreciated.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11q53pp/discussion_searching_for_endtoend_mlops_training/","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["machinelearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":8},"text":"[Discussion] Searching for end-to-end MLOps training solution I am working in a small research group and we recently found a problem with our resource utilization.

So we came up with the following two requirements:\n\n* Queue for training/inference tasks with dynamic GPU allocation (ex. you can launch 4 tasks on one machine that require 1 GPU each, or 2 tasks with 2 GPU, etc.)\n* Ability to reserve GPUs so that you can connect to the host and work directly (for example you want to launch 3rd party repository with complex environment setup)\n\nThe only solution I found so far is ClearML with clearml agent, but there are two problems with it, the first one is dynamic GPU allocation is available only in enterprise edition, which means that we need to reserve some hosts to run 2 GPU tasks and some that run 1 GPU tasks, which is not ideal. The second is that you can't directly tell clearml to not use some gpu for the time, so we used a crutch - launch an task with infinite loop in it that does nothing, which is once again is not ideal.\n\nHave some of you encountered a similar problems? How did you solve it? Maybe there is a solution that we missed, any help is appreciated.","classes":{"dataset":0.3743193746,"prompteng":0.2417267561}}

Many important industrial systems are multi-agent in nature and are difficult to model using bespoke simulators. However, in industry, distributed system processes can often be recorded during operation, and large quantities of demonstrative data can be stored. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising paradigm for building effective online controllers from static datasets. However, offline MARL is still in its infancy, and, therefore, lacks standardised benchmarks, baselines and evaluation protocols typically found in more mature subfields of RL.

In this work, we aim to fill this gap by releasing \\emph{off-the-grid MARL (OG-MARL)}: a framework for generating offline MARL datasets and algorithms.

Most existing studies on trustworthy FL aim to eliminate data poisoning threats that are produced by malicious clients, but in many cases, eliminating model poisoning attacks brought by fake servers is also an important objective. In this paper, a certificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL) framework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and server. In CATFL, each client verifies the server's signature information before accepting the delivered global model to ensure that the global model is not delivered by false servers. On the contrary, the server also verifies the server's signature information before accepting the delivered model updates to ensure that they are submitted by authorized clients. Compared to PKI-based methods, the CATFL can avoid too high certificate management overheads. Meanwhile, the anonymity of clients shields data poisoning attacks, while real-name registration may suffer from user-specific privacy leakage risks. Therefore, a pseudonym generation strategy is also presented in CATFL to achieve a trade-off between identity traceability and user anonymity, which is essential to conditionally prevent from user-specific privacy leakage.

{"title":"Generative Modeling with Quantum Neurons","description":"The recently proposed Quantum Neuron Born Machine (QNBM) has demonstrated quality initial performance as the first quantum generative machine learning (ML) model proposed with non-linear activations. However, previous investigations have been limited in scope with regards to the model's learnability and simulatability. In this work, we make a considerable leap forward by providing an extensive deep dive into the QNBM's potential as a generative model. We first demonstrate that the QNBM's network representation makes it non-trivial to be classically efficiently simulated. Following this result, we showcase the model's ability to learn (express and train on) a wider set of probability distributions, and benchmark the performance against a classical Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The QNBM is able to outperform this classical model on all distributions, even for the most optimally trained RBM among our simulations. Specifically, the QNBM outperforms the RBM with an improvement factor of 75.3x, 6.4x, and 3.5x for the discrete Gaussian, cardinality-constrained, and Bars and Stripes distributions respectively. Lastly, we conduct an initial investigation into the model's generalization capabilities and use a KL test to show that the model is able to approximate the ground truth probability distribution more closely than the training distribution when given access to a limited amount of data.

{"title":"Stable Target Field for Reduced Variance Score Estimation in Diffusion Models","description":"Diffusion models generate samples by reversing a fixed forward diffusion process. Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective. We argue that the source of such variance lies in the handling of intermediate noise-variance scales, where multiple modes in the data affect the direction of reverse paths. We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing (the trace of) the covariance of training targets. The new stable targets can be seen as trading bias for reduced variance, where the bias vanishes with increasing reference batch size.

Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective. We argue that the source of such variance lies in the handling of intermediate noise-variance scales, where multiple modes in the data affect the direction of reverse paths. We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing (the trace of) the covariance of training targets. The new stable targets can be seen as trading bias for reduced variance, where the bias vanishes with increasing reference batch size.

{"title":"A latent space for unsupervised MR image quality control via artifact assessment","description":"Image quality control (IQC) can be used in automated magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis to exclude erroneous results caused by poorly acquired or artifact-laden images. Existing IQC methods for MR imaging generally require human effort to craft meaningful features or label large datasets for supervised training. The involvement of human labor can be burdensome and biased, as labeling MR images based on their quality is a subjective task. In this paper, we propose an automatic IQC method that evaluates the extent of artifacts in MR images without supervision. In particular, we design an artifact encoding network that learns representations of artifacts based on contrastive learning. We then use a normalizing flow to estimate the density of learned representations for unsupervised classification. Our experiments on large-scale multi-cohort MR datasets show that the proposed method accurately detects images with high levels of artifacts, which can inform downstream analysis tasks about potentially flawed data.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00528v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"A latent space for unsupervised MR image quality control via artifact assessment Image quality control (IQC) can be used in automated magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis to exclude erroneous results caused by poorly acquired or artifact-laden images.

{"title":"CzSL: A new learning paradigm for astronomical image classification with citizen science","description":"Citizen science is gaining popularity as a valuable tool for labelling large collections of astronomical images by the general public. This is often achieved at the cost of poorer quality classifications made by amateur participants, which are usually verified by employing smaller data sets labelled by professional astronomers. Despite its success, citizen science alone will not be able to handle the classification of current and upcoming surveys. To alleviate this issue, citizen science projects have been coupled with machine learning techniques in pursuit of a more robust automated classification. However, existing approaches have neglected the fact that, apart from the data labelled by amateurs, (limited) expert knowledge of the problem is also available along with vast amounts of unlabelled data that have not yet been exploited within a unified learning framework. This paper presents an innovative learning paradigm for citizen science capable of taking advantage of expert- and amateur-labelled data, and unlabelled data. The proposed methodology first learns from unlabelled data with a convolutional autoencoder and then exploits amateur and expert labels via the pre-training and fine-tuning of a convolutional neural network, respectively. We focus on the classification of galaxy images from the Galaxy Zoo project, from which we test binary, multi-class, and imbalanced classification scenarios. The results demonstrate that our solution is able to improve classification performance compared to a set of baseline approaches, deploying a promising methodology for learning from different confidence levels in data labelling.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00366v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"CzSL: A new learning paradigm for astronomical image classification with citizen science Citizen science is gaining popularity as a valuable tool for labelling large collections of astronomical images by the general public.

{"title":"Stable Attribute Group Editing for Reliable Few-shot Image Generation","description":"Few-shot image generation aims to generate data of an unseen category based on only a few samples. Apart from basic content generation, a bunch of downstream applications hopefully benefit from this task, such as low-data detection and few-shot classification. To achieve this goal, the generated images should guarantee category retention for classification beyond the visual quality and diversity. In our preliminary work, we present an ``editing-based'' framework Attribute Group Editing (AGE) for reliable few-shot image generation, which largely improves the generation performance. Nevertheless, AGE's performance on downstream classification is not as satisfactory as expected. This paper investigates the class inconsistency problem and proposes Stable Attribute Group Editing (SAGE) for more stable class-relevant image generation. SAGE takes use of all given few-shot images and estimates a class center embedding based on the category-relevant attribute dictionary. Meanwhile, according to the projection weights on the category-relevant attribute dictionary, we can select category-irrelevant attributes from the similar seen categories. Consequently, SAGE injects the whole distribution of the novel class into StyleGAN's latent space, thus largely remains the category retention and stability of the generated images. Going one step further, we find that class inconsistency is a common problem in GAN-generated images for downstream classification. Even though the generated images look photo-realistic and requires no category-relevant editing, they are usually of limited help for downstream classification. We systematically discuss this issue from both the generative model and classification model perspectives, and propose to boost the downstream classification performance of SAGE by enhancing the pixel and frequency components.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00179v1","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Stable Attribute Group Editing for Reliable Few-shot Image Generation Few-shot image generation aims to generate data of an unseen category based on only a few samples.

{"title":"MG-ShopDial: A Multi-Goal Conversational Dataset for e-Commerce","description":"Conversational systems can be particularly effective in supporting complex information seeking scenarios with evolving information needs. Finding the right products on an e-commerce platform is one such scenario, where a conversational agent would need to be able to provide search capabilities over the item catalog, understand and make recommendations based on the user's preferences, and answer a range of questions related to items and their usage. Yet, existing conversational datasets do not fully support the idea of mixing different conversational goals (i.e., search, recommendation, and question answering) and instead focus on a single goal. To address this, we introduce MG-ShopDial: a dataset of conversations mixing different goals in the domain of e-commerce. Specifically, we make the following contributions. First, we develop a coached human-human data collection protocol where each dialogue participant is given a set of instructions, instead of a specific script or answers to choose from. Second, we implement a data collection tool to facilitate the collection of multi-goal conversations via a web chat interface, using the above protocol. Third, we create the MG-ShopDial collection, which contains 64 high-quality dialogues with a total of 2,196 utterances for e-commerce scenarios of varying complexity.

{"title":"Rubik's Optical Neural Networks: Multi-task Learning with Physics-aware Rotation Architecture","description":"Recently, there are increasing efforts on advancing optical neural networks (ONNs), which bring significant advantages for machine learning (ML) in terms of power efficiency, parallelism, and computational speed. With the considerable benefits in computation speed and energy efficiency, there are significant interests in leveraging ONNs into medical sensing, security screening, drug detection, and autonomous driving. However, due to the challenge of implementing reconfigurability, deploying multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms on ONNs requires re-building and duplicating the physical diffractive systems, which significantly degrades the energy and cost efficiency in practical application scenarios.

{"title":"Differential Privacy via Distributionally Robust Optimization","description":"In recent years, differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for sharing statistics of datasets while limiting the disclosure of private information about the involved individuals. This is achieved by randomly perturbing the statistics to be published, which in turn leads to a privacy-accuracy trade-off: larger perturbations provide stronger privacy guarantees, but they result in less accurate statistics that offer lower utility to the recipients. Of particular interest are therefore optimal mechanisms that provide the highest accuracy for a pre-selected level of privacy. To date, work in this area has focused on specifying families of perturbations a priori and subsequently proving their asymptotic and/or best-in-class optimality. In this paper, we develop a class of mechanisms that enjoy non-asymptotic and unconditional optimality guarantees. To this end, we formulate the mechanism design problem as an infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem. We show that the problem affords a strong dual, and we exploit this duality to develop converging hierarchies of finite-dimensional upper and lower bounding problems. Our upper (primal) bounds correspond to implementable perturbations whose suboptimality can be bounded by our lower (dual) bounds.

{"title":"Recovering 3D Hand Mesh Sequence from a Single Blurry Image: A New Dataset and Temporal Unfolding","description":"Hands, one of the most dynamic parts of our body, suffer from blur due to their active movements. However, previous 3D hand mesh recovery methods have mainly focused on sharp hand images rather than considering blur due to the absence of datasets providing blurry hand images. We first present a novel dataset BlurHand, which contains blurry hand images with 3D groundtruths. The BlurHand is constructed by synthesizing motion blur from sequential sharp hand images, imitating realistic and natural motion blurs. In addition to the new dataset, we propose BlurHandNet, a baseline network for accurate 3D hand mesh recovery from a blurry hand image. Our BlurHandNet unfolds a blurry input image to a 3D hand mesh sequence to utilize temporal information in the blurry input image, while previous works output a static single hand mesh. We demonstrate the usefulness of BlurHand for the 3D hand mesh recovery from blurry images in our experiments. The proposed BlurHandNet produces much more robust results on blurry images while generalizing well to in-the-wild images.

{"title":"Towards Artistic Image Aesthetics Assessment: a Large-scale Dataset and a New Method","description":"Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its highly subjective nature. Most of the current studies rely on large-scale datasets (e.g., AVA and AADB) to learn a general model for all kinds of photography images. However, little light has been shed on measuring the aesthetic quality of artistic images, and the existing datasets only contain relatively few artworks. Such a defect is a great obstacle to the aesthetic assessment of artistic images. To fill the gap in the field of artistic image aesthetics assessment (AIAA), we first introduce a large-scale AIAA dataset: Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), which consists of 60,337 artistic images covering various art forms, with more than 360,000 votes from online users. We then propose a new method, SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network), which can effectively extract and utilize style-specific and generic aesthetic information to evaluate artistic images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing IAA methods on the proposed BAID dataset according to quantitative comparisons. We believe the proposed dataset and method can serve as a foundation for future AIAA works and inspire more research in this field.

However, little light has been shed on measuring the aesthetic quality of artistic images, and the existing datasets only contain relatively few artworks. Such a defect is a great obstacle to the aesthetic assessment of artistic images. To fill the gap in the field of artistic image aesthetics assessment (AIAA), we first introduce a large-scale AIAA dataset: Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), which consists of 60,337 artistic images covering various art forms, with more than 360,000 votes from online users. We then propose a new method, SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network), which can effectively extract and utilize style-specific and generic aesthetic information to evaluate artistic images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing IAA methods on the proposed BAID dataset according to quantitative comparisons. We believe the proposed dataset and method can serve as a foundation for future AIAA works and inspire more research in this field.

{"title":"A large-scale dataset for end-to-end table recognition in the wild","description":"Table recognition (TR) is one of the research hotspots in pattern recognition, which aims to extract information from tables in an image. Common table recognition tasks include table detection (TD), table structure recognition (TSR) and table content recognition (TCR). TD is to locate tables in the image, TCR recognizes text content, and TSR recognizes spatial ogical structure. Currently, the end-to-end TR in real scenarios, accomplishing the three sub-tasks simultaneously, is yet an unexplored research area. One major factor that inhibits researchers is the lack of a benchmark dataset. To this end, we propose a new large-scale dataset named Table Recognition Set (TabRecSet) with diverse table forms sourcing from multiple scenarios in the wild, providing complete annotation dedicated to end-to-end TR research. It is the largest and first bi-lingual dataset for end-to-end TR, with 38.1K tables in which 20.4K are in English\\, and 17.7K are in Chinese. The samples have diverse forms, such as the border-complete and -incomplete table, regular and irregular table (rotated, distorted, etc.). The scenarios are multiple in the wild, varying from scanned to camera-taken images, documents to Excel tables, educational test papers to financial invoices. The annotations are complete, consisting of the table body spatial annotation, cell spatial logical annotation and text content for TD, TSR and TCR, respectively. The spatial annotation utilizes the polygon instead of the bounding box or quadrilateral adopted by most datasets. The polygon spatial annotation is more suitable for irregular tables that are common in wild scenarios.

{"title":"The Resource Problem of Using Linear Layer Leakage Attack in Federated Learning","description":"Secure aggregation promises a heightened level of privacy in federated learning, maintaining that a server only has access to a decrypted aggregate update. Within this setting, linear layer leakage methods are the only data reconstruction attacks able to scale and achieve a high leakage rate regardless of the number of clients or batch size. This is done through increasing the size of an injected fully-connected (FC) layer. However, this results in a resource overhead which grows larger with an increasing number of clients. We show that this resource overhead is caused by an incorrect perspective in all prior work that treats an attack on an aggregate update in the same way as an individual update with a larger batch size. Instead, by attacking the update from the perspective that aggregation is combining multiple individual updates, this allows the application of sparsity to alleviate resource overhead. We show that the use of sparsity can decrease the model size overhead by over 327$\\times$ and the computation time by 3.34$\\times$ compared to SOTA while maintaining equivalent total leakage rate, 77% even with $1000$ clients in aggregation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14868v1","created":"2023-03-27","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"The Resource Problem of Using Linear Layer Leakage Attack in Federated Learning Secure aggregation promises a heightened level of privacy in federated learning, maintaining that a server only has access to a decrypted aggregate update.

These kinds of methods often process video images or parts, therefore the integrity of such images is crucial. Sometimes datasets, e.g. consisting of images, can be sophisticated for various reasons. It becomes critical to understand how the manipulation of video and images can impact the effectiveness of a machine learning method. Our case study aims precisely to analyze the Linemod dataset, considered the state of the art in 6D pose estimation context. That dataset presents images accompanied by ArUco markers; it is evident that such markers will not be available in real-world contexts. We analyze how the presence of the markers affects the pose estimation accuracy, and how this bias may be mitigated through data augmentation and other methods. Our work aims to show how the presence of these markers goes to modify, in the testing phase, the effectiveness of the deep learning method used. In particular, we will demonstrate, through the tool of saliency maps, how the focus of the neural network is captured in part by these ArUco markers. Finally, a new dataset, obtained by applying geometric tools to Linemod, will be proposed in order to demonstrate our hypothesis and uncovering the bias.

{"title":"Human Pose Estimation in Monocular Omnidirectional Top-View Images","description":"Human pose estimation (HPE) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for indoor monitoring is one of the major challenges in computer vision. In contrast to HPE in perspective views, an indoor monitoring system can consist of an omnidirectional camera with a field of view of 180{\\deg} to detect the pose of a person with only one sensor per room. To recognize human pose, the detection of keypoints is an essential upstream step. In our work we propose a new dataset for training and evaluation of CNNs for the task of keypoint detection in omnidirectional images. The training dataset, THEODORE+, consists of 50,000 images and is created by a 3D rendering engine, where humans are randomly walking through an indoor environment. In a dynamically created 3D scene, persons move randomly with simultaneously moving omnidirectional camera to generate synthetic RGB images and 2D and 3D ground truth. For evaluation purposes, the real-world PoseFES dataset with two scenarios and 701 frames with up to eight persons per scene was captured and annotated. We propose four training paradigms to finetune or re-train two top-down models in MMPose and two bottom-up models in CenterNet on THEODORE+. Beside a qualitative evaluation we report quantitative results. Compared to a COCO pretrained baseline, we achieve significant improvements especially for top-view scenes on the PoseFES dataset.

SAM can accurately segment images across diverse fields, and generating various masks. We discovered that this ability of SAM can be leveraged to pretrain models for specific fields. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that utilizes SAM to generate pseudo labels for pretraining thermal infrared image segmentation tasks. Our proposed framework can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation results of specific categories beyond the SOTA ImageNet pretrained model. Our framework presents a novel approach to collaborate with models trained with large data like SAM to address problems in special fields. Also, we generated a large scale thermal infrared segmentation dataset used for pretaining, which contains over 100,000 images with pixel-annotation labels.

SAM can accurately segment images across diverse fields, and generating various masks. We discovered that this ability of SAM can be leveraged to pretrain models for specific fields. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that utilizes SAM to generate pseudo labels for pretraining thermal infrared image segmentation tasks. Our proposed framework can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation results of specific categories beyond the SOTA ImageNet pretrained model. Our framework presents a novel approach to collaborate with models trained with large data like SAM to address problems in special fields. Also, we generated a large scale thermal infrared segmentation dataset used for pretaining, which contains over 100,000 images with pixel-annotation labels.

{"title":"Evil from Within: Machine Learning Backdoors through Hardware Trojans","description":"Backdoors pose a serious threat to machine learning, as they can compromise the integrity of security-critical systems, such as self-driving cars. While different defenses have been proposed to address this threat, they all rely on the assumption that the hardware on which the learning models are executed during inference is trusted. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and introduce a backdoor attack that completely resides within a common hardware accelerator for machine learning. Outside of the accelerator, neither the learning model nor the software is manipulated, so that current defenses fail. To make this attack practical, we overcome two challenges: First, as memory on a hardware accelerator is severely limited, we introduce the concept of a minimal backdoor that deviates as little as possible from the original model and is activated by replacing a few model parameters only. Second, we develop a configurable hardware trojan that can be provisioned with the backdoor and performs a replacement only when the specific target model is processed. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our attack by implanting our hardware trojan into the Xilinx Vitis AI DPU, a commercial machine-learning accelerator. We configure the trojan with a minimal backdoor for a traffic-sign recognition system. The backdoor replaces only 30 (0.069%) model parameters, yet it reliably manipulates the recognition once the input contains a backdoor trigger. Our attack expands the hardware circuit of the accelerator by 0.24% and induces no run-time overhead, rendering a detection hardly possible. Given the complex and highly distributed manufacturing process of current hardware, our work points to a new threat in machine learning that is inaccessible to current security mechanisms and calls for hardware to be manufactured only in fully trusted environments.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08411v1","created":"2023-04-17","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Evil from Within: Machine Learning Backdoors through Hardware Trojans Backdoors pose a serious threat to machine learning, as they can compromise the integrity of security-critical systems, such as self-driving cars.

{"title":"The Audio-Visual BatVision Dataset for Research on Sight and Sound","description":"Vision research showed remarkable success in understanding our world, propelled by datasets of images and videos. Sensor data from radar, LiDAR and cameras supports research in robotics and autonomous driving for at least a decade. However, while visual sensors may fail in some conditions, sound has recently shown potential to complement sensor data. Simulated room impulse responses (RIR) in 3D apartment-models became a benchmark dataset for the community, fostering a range of audiovisual research. In simulation, depth is predictable from sound, by learning bat-like perception with a neural network. Concurrently, the same was achieved in reality by using RGB-D images and echoes of chirping sounds. Biomimicking bat perception is an exciting new direction but needs dedicated datasets to explore the potential. Therefore, we collected the BatVision dataset to provide large-scale echoes in complex real-world scenes to the community. We equipped a robot with a speaker to emit chirps and a binaural microphone to record their echoes. Synchronized RGB-D images from the same perspective provide visual labels of traversed spaces. We sampled modern US office spaces to historic French university grounds, indoor and outdoor with large architectural variety. This dataset will allow research on robot echolocation, general audio-visual tasks and sound phaenomena unavailable in simulated data.

{"title":"Identifying Label Errors in Object Detection Datasets by Loss Inspection","description":"Labeling datasets for supervised object detection is a dull and time-consuming task. Errors can be easily introduced during annotation and overlooked during review, yielding inaccurate benchmarks and performance degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we for the first time introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on object detection datasets as well as a label error detection method and a number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets. For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We compare our method to three baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the object detector's score and the entropy of the classification softmax distribution. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four types efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset. In both cases we achieve low false positives rates, i.e., when considering 200 proposals from our method, we detect label errors with a precision for a) of up to 71.5% and for b) with 97%.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06999v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""},"text":"Identifying Label Errors in Object Detection Datasets by Loss Inspection Labeling datasets for supervised object detection is a dull and time-consuming task.

{"title":"Semantically Secure Private Set Intersection over Outsourced Multi-Owner Secret-Shared Databases","description":"Private set intersection (PSI) aims to allow users to find out the commonly shared items among the users without revealing other membership information. The most recently proposed approach to PSI in the database community was Prism, which is built upon secret sharing and the assumption that multiple non-colluding servers are available. One limitation of Prism lies in its semantic security: the encoding on the servers is deterministic, implying that the scheme cannot be indistinguishable under a chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA).

By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression) and compatible with different designs of enhancement modules.

To tackle this robustness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2) to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression) and compatible with different designs of enhancement modules. Experiments in various settings show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded synthetic and real-world datasets.","classes":{"dataset":0.2363359332,"prompteng":0.006745121}}

{"title":"[D] ChatGPT without text limits.","description":"One of the biggest limitations of large language models is the text limit. This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.\n\nThis was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.\n\nThis will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.\n\nThe paper talks about the use of \"associative memory\" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.\n\nPresumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.\n\nThe paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.\n\nAnother potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.\n\nThe use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.\n\nI'm curious to read your thoughts.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11qgxs8/d_chatgpt_without_text_limits/","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["machinelearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":11},"text":"[D] ChatGPT without text limits.

{"title":"SportsPose -- A Dynamic 3D sports pose dataset","description":"Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website.

Generating valid input programs for fuzzing DL libraries is challenging due to the need for satisfying both language syntax/semantics and constraints for constructing valid computational graphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraints to generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generate ordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive training corpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are unlikely to be manually produced.   To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include rare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditional techniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human efforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generated programs. FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains.

However, in practice, low-quality (LQ) medical images, such as images that are hazy/blurry, have uneven illumination, or are out of focus, among others, are often obtained during data acquisition. This leads to difficulties in the screening and diagnosis of medical diseases. Several generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based image enhancement methods have been proposed and have shown promising results. However, there is a quality-originality trade-off among these methods in the sense that they produce visually pleasing results but lose the ability to preserve originality, especially the structural inputs. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no objective metric in evaluating the structure preservation of medical image enhancement methods in unsupervised settings due to the unavailability of paired ground-truth data. In this study, we propose a framework for practical unsupervised medical image enhancement that includes (1) a non-reference objective evaluation of structure preservation for medical image enhancement tasks called Laplacian structural similarity index measure (LaSSIM), which is based on SSIM and the Laplacian pyramid, and (2) a novel unsupervised GAN-based method called Laplacian medical image enhancement (LaMEGAN) to support the improvement of both originality and quality from LQ images. The LaSSIM metric does not require clean reference images and has been shown to be superior to SSIM in capturing image structural changes under image degradations, such as strong blurring on different datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our LaMEGAN achieves a satisfactory balance between quality and originality, with robust structure preservation performance while generating compelling visual results with very high image quality scores. The code will be made available at https://github.com/AillisInc/USPMIE.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01864v1","created":"2023-04-04","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"A Practical Framework for Unsupervised Structure Preservation Medical Image Enhancement Medical images are extremely valuable for supporting medical diagnoses.

{"title":"Analysis of Software Engineering Practices in General Software and Machine Learning Startups","description":"Context: On top of the inherent challenges startup software companies face applying proper software engineering practices, the non-deterministic nature of machine learning techniques makes it even more difficult for machine learning (ML) startups.   Objective: Therefore, the objective of our study is to understand the whole picture of software engineering practices followed by ML startups and identify additional needs.   Method: To achieve our goal, we conducted a systematic literature review study on 37 papers published in the last 21 years. We selected papers on both general software startups and ML startups. We collected data to understand software engineering (SE) practices in five phases of the software development life-cycle: requirement engineering, design, development, quality assurance, and deployment.   Results: We find some interesting differences in software engineering practices in ML startups and general software startups. The data management and model learning phases are the most prominent among them.   Conclusion: While ML startups face many similar challenges to general software startups, the additional difficulties of using stochastic ML models require different strategies in using software engineering practices to produce high-quality products.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01523v1","created":"2023-04-04","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Analysis of Software Engineering Practices in General Software and Machine Learning Startups Context: On top of the inherent challenges startup software companies face applying proper software engineering practices, the non-deterministic nature of machine learning techniques makes it even more difficult for machine learning (ML) startups.

{"title":"Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation for 3D Semi-Supervised Object Detection","description":"State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are usually trained on large-scale datasets with high-quality 3D annotations. However, such 3D annotations are often expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real applications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by leveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples. Current pseudolabeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a teacher-student framework, with a single fixed threshold strategy to generate supervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding the student network training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic down sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the effective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the shuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments show that HSSDA consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/azhuantou/HSSDA.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01464v1","created":"2023-04-04","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation for 3D Semi-Supervised Object Detection State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are usually trained on large-scale datasets with high-quality 3D annotations.

{"title":"MaskCon: Masked Contrastive Learning for Coarse-Labelled Dataset","description":"Deep learning has achieved great success in recent years with the aid of advanced neural network structures and large-scale human-annotated datasets. However, it is often costly and difficult to accurately and efficiently annotate large-scale datasets, especially for some specialized domains where fine-grained labels are required. In this setting, coarse labels are much easier to acquire as they do not require expert knowledge. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning method, called $\\textbf{Mask}$ed $\\textbf{Con}$trastive learning~($\\textbf{MaskCon}$) to address the under-explored problem setting, where we learn with a coarse-labelled dataset in order to address a finer labelling problem. More specifically, within the contrastive learning framework, for each sample our method generates soft-labels with the aid of coarse labels against other samples and another augmented view of the sample in question. By contrast to self-supervised contrastive learning where only the sample's augmentations are considered hard positives, and in supervised contrastive learning where only samples with the same coarse labels are considered hard positives, we propose soft labels based on sample distances, that are masked by the coarse labels. This allows us to utilize both inter-sample relations and coarse labels. We demonstrate that our method can obtain as special cases many existing state-of-the-art works and that it provides tighter bounds on the generalization error. Experimentally, our method achieves significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art in various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1K, Standford Online Products and Stanford Cars196 datasets.

{"title":"RaBit: Parametric Modeling of 3D Biped Cartoon Characters with a Topological-consistent Dataset","description":"Assisting people in efficiently producing visually plausible 3D characters has always been a fundamental research topic in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent learning-based approaches have achieved unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in the area of 3D real human digitization. However, none of the prior works focus on modeling 3D biped cartoon characters, which are also in great demand in gaming and filming. In this paper, we introduce 3DBiCar, the first large-scale dataset of 3D biped cartoon characters, and RaBit, the corresponding parametric model. Our dataset contains 1,500 topologically consistent high-quality 3D textured models which are manually crafted by professional artists. Built upon the data, RaBit is thus designed with a SMPL-like linear blend shape model and a StyleGAN-based neural UV-texture generator, simultaneously expressing the shape, pose, and texture. To demonstrate the practicality of 3DBiCar and RaBit, various applications are conducted, including single-view reconstruction, sketch-based modeling, and 3D cartoon animation. For the single-view reconstruction setting, we find a straightforward global mapping from input images to the output UV-based texture maps tends to lose detailed appearances of some local parts (e.g., nose, ears). Thus, a part-sensitive texture reasoner is adopted to make all important local areas perceived. Experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. 3DBiCar and RaBit are available at gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/projects/RaBit.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12564v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"RaBit: Parametric Modeling of 3D Biped Cartoon Characters with a Topological-consistent Dataset Assisting people in efficiently producing visually plausible 3D characters has always been a fundamental research topic in computer vision and computer graphics.

{"title":"Reliable and Efficient Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness for Deep Hashing-Based Retrieval","description":"Deep hashing has been extensively applied to massive image retrieval due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recently, several adversarial attacks have been presented to reveal the vulnerability of deep hashing models against adversarial examples. However, existing attack methods suffer from degraded performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations between original samples or spend a lot of time learning these relations with a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a novel Pharos-guided Attack, dubbed PgA, to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep hashing networks reliably and efficiently. Specifically, we design pharos code to represent the semantics of the benign image, which preserves the similarity to semantically relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly, PgA can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in both attack strength and speed.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12658v1","created":"2023-03-22","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Reliable and Efficient Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness for Deep Hashing-Based Retrieval Deep hashing has been extensively applied to massive image retrieval due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

{"title":"Safety Assessment of Chinese Large Language Models","description":"With the rapid popularity of large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, a growing amount of attention is paid to their safety concerns. These models may generate insulting and discriminatory content, reflect incorrect social values, and may be used for malicious purposes such as fraud and dissemination of misleading information. Evaluating and enhancing their safety is particularly essential for the wide application of large language models (LLMs). To further promote the safe deployment of LLMs, we develop a Chinese LLM safety assessment benchmark. Our benchmark explores the comprehensive safety performance of LLMs from two perspectives: 8 kinds of typical safety scenarios and 6 types of more challenging instruction attacks. Our benchmark is based on a straightforward process in which it provides the test prompts and evaluates the safety of the generated responses from the evaluated model.

Evaluating and enhancing their safety is particularly essential for the wide application of large language models (LLMs). To further promote the safe deployment of LLMs, we develop a Chinese LLM safety assessment benchmark. Our benchmark explores the comprehensive safety performance of LLMs from two perspectives: 8 kinds of typical safety scenarios and 6 types of more challenging instruction attacks.

{"title":"\"Oops, Did I Just Say That?\" Testing and Repairing Unethical Suggestions of Large Language Models with Suggest-Critique-Reflect Process","description":"As the popularity of large language models (LLMs) soars across various applications, ensuring their alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. In particular, given that LLMs have great potential to serve as general-purpose AI assistants in daily life, their subtly unethical suggestions become a serious and real concern. Tackling the challenge of automatically testing and repairing unethical suggestions is thus demanding.   This paper introduces the first framework for testing and repairing unethical suggestions made by LLMs. We first propose ETHICSSUITE, a test suite that presents complex, contextualized, and realistic moral scenarios to test LLMs. We then propose a novel suggest-critic-reflect (SCR) process, serving as an automated test oracle to detect unethical suggestions. We recast deciding if LLMs yield unethical suggestions (a hard problem; often requiring human expertise and costly to decide) into a PCR task that can be automatically checked for violation. Moreover, we propose a novel on-the-fly (OTF) repairing scheme that repairs unethical suggestions made by LLMs in real-time. The OTF scheme is applicable to LLMs in a black-box API setting with moderate cost.

Nonetheless, important questions remain regarding their scalability. In this work, we investigate the barriers to the trainability of quantum generative models posed by barren plateaus and exponential loss concentration. We explore the interplay between explicit and implicit models and losses, and show that using implicit generative models (such as quantum circuit-based models) with explicit losses (such as the KL divergence) leads to a new flavour of barren plateau. In contrast, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which is a popular example of an implicit loss, can be viewed as the expectation value of an observable that is either low-bodied and trainable, or global and untrainable depending on the choice of kernel. However, in parallel, we highlight that the low-bodied losses required for trainability cannot in general distinguish high-order correlations, leading to a fundamental tension between exponential concentration and the emergence of spurious minima. We further propose a new local quantum fidelity-type loss which, by leveraging quantum circuits to estimate the quality of the encoded distribution, is both faithful and enjoys trainability guarantees.

{"title":"An Efficient Built-in Temporal Support in MVCC-based Graph Databases","description":"Real-world graphs are often dynamic and evolve over time. To trace the evolving properties of graphs, it is necessary to maintain every change of both vertices and edges in graph databases with the support of temporal features. Existing works either maintain all changes in a single graph or periodically materialize snapshots to maintain the historical states of each vertex and edge and process queries over proper snapshots. The former approach presents poor query performance due to the ever-growing graph size as time goes by, while the latter one suffers from prohibitively high storage overheads due to large redundant copies of graph data across different snapshots. In this paper, we propose a hybrid data storage engine, which is based on the MVCC mechanism, to separately manage current and historical data, which keeps the current graph as small as possible. In our design, changes in each vertex or edge are stored once. To further reduce the storage overhead, we simply store the changes as opposed to storing the complete snapshot. To boost the query performance, we place a few anchors as snapshots to avoid deep historical version traversals. Based on the storage engine, a temporal query engine is proposed to reconstruct subgraphs as needed on the fly. Therefore, our alternative approach can provide fast querying capabilities over subgraphs at a past time point or range with small storage overheads.

With large neural models and massive available data, current dialogue systems have access to more knowledge than any people in their life. However, current dialogue systems still do not perform at a human level. One major gap between conversational agents and humans lies in their abilities to be aware of social norms. The development of socially-aware dialogue systems is impeded due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we present the first socially-aware dialogue corpus - SocialDial, based on Chinese social culture. SocialDial consists of two parts: 1,563 multi-turn dialogues between two human speakers with fine-grained labels, and 4,870 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT. The human corpus covers five categories of social norms, which have 14 sub-categories in total. Specifically, it contains social factor annotations including social relation, context, social distance, and social norms. However, collecting sufficient socially-aware dialogues is costly. Thus, we harness the power of ChatGPT and devise an ontology-based synthetic data generation framework. This framework is able to generate synthetic data at scale. To ensure the quality of synthetic dialogues, we design several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate our dataset using several pre-trained models, such as BERT and RoBERTa. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models demonstrate that modeling of social norms for dialogue systems is a promising research direction. To the best of our knowledge, SocialDial is the first socially-aware dialogue dataset that covers multiple social factors and has fine-grained labels.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12026v1","created":"2023-04-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"SocialDial: A Benchmark for Socially-Aware Dialogue Systems Dialogue systems have been widely applied in many scenarios and are now more powerful and ubiquitous than ever before.

The dataset includes synchronized egocentric and exocentric images sampled from the recent Assembly101 dataset, in which participants assemble and disassemble take-apart toys. To obtain high-quality 3D hand pose annotations for the egocentric images, we develop an efficient pipeline, where we use an initial set of manual annotations to train a model to automatically annotate a much larger dataset. Our annotation model uses multi-view feature fusion and an iterative refinement scheme, and achieves an average keypoint error of 4.20 mm, which is 85% lower than the error of the original annotations in Assembly101. AssemblyHands provides 3.0M annotated images, including 490K egocentric images, making it the largest existing benchmark dataset for egocentric 3D hand pose estimation. Using this data, we develop a strong single-view baseline of 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images. Furthermore, we design a novel action classification task to evaluate predicted 3D hand poses.

{"title":"PAXQA: Generating Cross-lingual Question Answering Examples at Training Scale","description":"Existing question answering (QA) systems owe much of their success to large, high-quality training data. Such annotation efforts are costly, and the difficulty compounds in the cross-lingual setting. Therefore, prior cross-lingual QA work has focused on releasing evaluation datasets, and then applying zero-shot methods as baselines. In this work, we propose a synthetic data generation method for cross-lingual QA which leverages indirect supervision from existing parallel corpora. Our method termed PAXQA ({P}rojecting {a}nnotations for cross-lingual ({x}) QA) decomposes cross-lingual QA into two stages. In the first stage, we apply a question generation (QG) model to the English side. In the second stage, we apply annotation projection to translate both the questions and answers. To better translate questions, we propose a novel use of lexically-constrained machine translation, in which constrained entities are extracted from the parallel bitexts. We release cross-lingual QA datasets across 4 languages, totaling 662K QA examples. We then show that extractive QA models fine-tuned on these datasets outperform both zero-shot and prior synthetic data generation models, showing the sufficient quality of our generations. We find that the largest performance gains are for cross-lingual directions with non-English questions and English contexts. Ablation studies show that our dataset generation method is relatively robust to noise from automatic word alignments.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12206v1","created":"2023-04-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"PAXQA: Generating Cross-lingual Question Answering Examples at Training Scale Existing question answering (QA) systems owe much of their success to large, high-quality training data.

{"title":"Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models","description":"Customers' load profiles are critical resources to support data analytics applications in modern power systems. However, there are usually insufficient historical load profiles for data analysis, due to the collection cost and data privacy issues. To address such data shortage problems, load profiles synthesis is an effective technique that provides synthetic training data for customers to build high-performance data-driven models. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to synthesize high-quality load profiles for each customer using generation models trained by the respective customer's data owing to the high heterogeneity of customer load. In this paper, we propose a novel customized load profiles synthesis method based on conditional diffusion models for heterogeneous customers. Specifically, we first convert the customized synthesis into a conditional data generation issue. We then extend traditional diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to the customer's load characteristics and application demands. In addition, to implement conditional diffusion models, we design a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles. Finally, numerical case studies based on a public dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12076v1","created":"2023-04-24","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"},"text":"Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models Customers' load profiles are critical resources to support data analytics applications in modern power systems.

PS documents may be used to conceal the artifacts of images which is due to the synthetic nature of images since these artifacts are typically present in manipulated images and the main artifacts in the synthetic images can be removed after the PS. Due to the appeal of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), synthetic face images generated with GANs models are difficult to differentiate from genuine human faces and may be used to create counterfeit identities. Additionally, since GANs models do not account for physiological constraints for generating human faces and their impact on human IRISes, distinguishing genuine from synthetic IRISes in the PS scenario becomes extremely difficult. As a result of the lack of large-scale reference IRIS datasets in the PS scenario, we aim at developing a novel dataset to become a standard for Multimedia Forensics (MFs) investigation which is available at [45]. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset made up of a large number of synthetic and natural printed IRISes taken from VIPPrint Printed and Scanned face images.

{"title":"When approximate design for fast homomorphic computation provides differential privacy guarantees","description":"While machine learning has become pervasive in as diversified fields as industry, healthcare, social networks, privacy concerns regarding the training data have gained a critical importance. In settings where several parties wish to collaboratively train a common model without jeopardizing their sensitive data, the need for a private training protocol is particularly stringent and implies to protect the data against both the model's end-users and the actors of the training phase. Differential privacy (DP) and cryptographic primitives are complementary popular countermeasures against privacy attacks. Among these cryptographic primitives, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers ciphertext malleability at the cost of time-consuming operations in the homomorphic domain. In this paper, we design SHIELD, a probabilistic approximation algorithm for the argmax operator which is both fast when homomorphically executed and whose inaccuracy is used as a feature to ensure DP guarantees. Even if SHIELD could have other applications, we here focus on one setting and seamlessly integrate it in the SPEED collaborative training framework from \"SPEED: Secure, PrivatE, and Efficient Deep learning\" (Grivet S\\'ebert et al., 2021) to improve its computational efficiency.

In settings where several parties wish to collaboratively train a common model without jeopardizing their sensitive data, the need for a private training protocol is particularly stringent and implies to protect the data against both the model's end-users and the actors of the training phase. Differential privacy (DP) and cryptographic primitives are complementary popular countermeasures against privacy attacks. Among these cryptographic primitives, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers ciphertext malleability at the cost of time-consuming operations in the homomorphic domain. In this paper, we design SHIELD, a probabilistic approximation algorithm for the argmax operator which is both fast when homomorphically executed and whose inaccuracy is used as a feature to ensure DP guarantees. Even if SHIELD could have other applications, we here focus on one setting and seamlessly integrate it in the SPEED collaborative training framework from \"SPEED: Secure, PrivatE, and Efficient Deep learning\" (Grivet S\\'ebert et al., 2021) to improve its computational efficiency.

{"title":"Tag that issue: Applying API-domain labels in issue tracking systems","description":"Labeling issues with the skills required to complete them can help contributors to choose tasks in Open Source Software projects. However, manually labeling issues is time-consuming and error-prone, and current automated approaches are mostly limited to classifying issues as bugs/non-bugs.

Therefore, we posit that the APIs used in the source code affected by an issue can be a proxy for the type of skills (e.g., DB, security, UI) needed to work on the issue. We ran a user study (n=74) to assess API-domain labels' relevancy to potential contributors, leveraged the issues' descriptions and the project history to build prediction models, and validated the predictions with contributors (n=20) of the projects.

{"title":"GIF: A General Graph Unlearning Strategy via Influence Function","description":"With the greater emphasis on privacy and security in our society, the problem of graph unlearning -- revoking the influence of specific data on the trained GNN model, is drawing increasing attention. However, ranging from machine unlearning to recently emerged graph unlearning methods, existing efforts either resort to retraining paradigm, or perform approximate erasure that fails to consider the inter-dependency between connected neighbors or imposes constraints on GNN structure, therefore hard to achieve satisfying performance-complexity trade-offs.   In this work, we explore the influence function tailored for graph unlearning, so as to improve the unlearning efficacy and efficiency for graph unlearning. We first present a unified problem formulation of diverse graph unlearning tasks \\wrt node, edge, and feature. Then, we recognize the crux to the inability of traditional influence function for graph unlearning, and devise Graph Influence Function (GIF), a model-agnostic unlearning method that can efficiently and accurately estimate parameter changes in response to a $\\epsilon$-mass perturbation in deleted data. The idea is to supplement the objective of the traditional influence function with an additional loss term of the influenced neighbors due to the structural dependency. Further deductions on the closed-form solution of parameter changes provide a better understanding of the unlearning mechanism.

{"title":"Efficient Federated Learning with Enhanced Privacy via Lottery Ticket Pruning in Edge Computing","description":"Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm for decentralized private data from mobile terminals (MTs). However, it suffers from issues in terms of communication, resource of MTs, and privacy. Existing privacy-preserving FL methods usually adopt the instance-level differential privacy (DP), which provides a rigorous privacy guarantee but with several bottlenecks: severe performance degradation, transmission overhead, and resource constraints of edge devices such as MTs.

Meanwhile, the performance of Fed-LTP is also boosted via model validation based on the Laplace mechanism. On the client side, we use sparse-to-sparse training to solve the resource-constraints issue and provide tighter privacy analysis to reduce the privacy budget. We evaluate the effectiveness of Fed-LTP on several real-world datasets in both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings.

{"title":"MDENet: Multi-modal Dual-embedding Networks for Malware Open-set Recognition","description":"Malware open-set recognition (MOSR) aims at jointly classifying malware samples from known families and detect the ones from novel unknown families, respectively. Existing works mostly rely on a well-trained classifier considering the predicted probabilities of each known family with a threshold-based detection to achieve the MOSR. However, our observation reveals that the feature distributions of malware samples are extremely similar to each other even between known and unknown families. Thus the obtained classifier may produce overly high probabilities of testing unknown samples toward known families and degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose the Multi-modal Dual-Embedding Networks, dubbed MDENet, to take advantage of comprehensive malware features (i.e., malware images and malware sentences) from different modalities to enhance the diversity of malware feature space, which is more representative and discriminative for down-stream recognition. Last, to further guarantee the open-set recognition, we dually embed the fused multi-modal representation into one primary space and an associated sub-space, i.e., discriminative and exclusive spaces, with contrastive sampling and rho-bounded enclosing sphere regularizations, which resort to classification and detection, respectively.

{"title":"Stratified Adversarial Robustness with Rejection","description":"Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified. In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method -- Adversarial Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection (CPR) -- for building a robust selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks. For instance, on CIFAR-10, CPR reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection losses) by at least 7.3% under both seen and unseen attacks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01139v1","created":"2023-05-02","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"},"text":"Stratified Adversarial Robustness with Rejection Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness.

More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as geometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter set that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and structural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point cloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact latent code.

{"title":"The AI Revolution in Education: Will AI Replace or Assist Teachers in Higher Education?","description":"This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education, specifically its capacity to replace or assist human teachers. By reviewing relevant literature and analysing survey data from students and teachers, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on the future role of educators in the face of advancing AI technologies. Findings suggest that although some believe AI may eventually replace teachers, the majority of participants argue that human teachers possess unique qualities, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotions, which make them irreplaceable. The study also emphasizes the importance of social-emotional competencies developed through human interactions, which AI technologies cannot currently replicate. The research proposes that teachers can effectively integrate AI to enhance teaching and learning without viewing it as a replacement. To do so, teachers need to understand how AI can work well with teachers and students while avoiding potential pitfalls, develop AI literacy, and address practical issues such as data protection, ethics, and privacy. The study reveals that students value and respect human teachers, even as AI becomes more prevalent in education. The study also introduces a roadmap for students, teachers, and universities. This roadmap serves as a valuable guide for refining teaching skills, fostering personal connections, and designing curriculums that effectively balance the strengths of human educators with AI technologies.
